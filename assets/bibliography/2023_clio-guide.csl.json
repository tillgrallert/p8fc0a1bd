  {"id":"Abdel-Ghaffar.Folsom+2021+CourtsandCanons","abstract":"The Courts and Canons project is an interactive, collaborative project placing the Islamic legal tradition in a historical, socio-political, hermeneutical, and geographic context. The project allows researchers to study Islamic legal canons not as isolated writings, but as part of dynamic legal procedures spanning centuries and continents. By connecting canons to court cases, legal schools, scholars, rationales, and various textual sources, the project places each canon in a procedural context, allowing the researcher to understand how each canon was developed and applied. At the same time, the project embeds each case, scholar, and canon within a specific geographic and political milieu. In doing so, the Courts and Canons project places legal rulings and over a millennium of sources in conversation with each other, a conversation spanning time, space, and school, without compromising the specific context that gave rise to each canon. Through translations of the legal canon, the tool this project produces is accessible to the non-specialist. At the same time, the specialist will be able to engage the original source of each case and canon in the original language. This presentation explores the scholarship, the custom database software, and the process we developed to enable this collaboration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Abdel-Ghaffar","given":"Omar"},{"family":"Folsom","given":"Jamie"}],"citation-key":"Abdel-Ghaffar.Folsom+2021+CourtsandCanons","event-place":"Online","event-title":"DHSI 2021: Right to Left","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,8]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"Courts and Canons","type":"speech","URL":"https://dhsi.org/dhsi-2021-online-edition/dhsi-2021-online-edition-aligned-conferences-and-events/dhsi-2021-right-to-left/full-access/"},

Processing its first collection, oral histories from the now defunct Swalif website, has been a proof-of-concept that is hoped to draw others to submit their oral histories for archival preservation. In addition to extending the life of the recordings, the QTAP project set out to produce transcriptions of the oral histories that were done in the Qatari dialect of Arabic. Transcription presented two issues. During the initial transcribing, younger Qataris working on the project found the language of an older generation to be filled with unfamiliar phrases and terms. Later, integrating the transcripts onto Aviary, a robust platform for audiovisual content, so that they were in line with the sound recordings proved to be another challenge. This paper will discuss these challenges and how they were dealt with in wanting to retain the centrality of Qatari Arabic on the QTAP site, as opposed to displacing them with English translations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Sumayya"}],"citation-key":"Ahmed+2021+LostinTranscription","event-place":"Online","event-title":"DHSI 2021: Right to Left","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,8]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"Lost in Transcription: Transcripts of Qatari Arabic on the Qatar Talking Archives Project (QTAP) site","type":"speech","URL":"https://dhsi.org/dhsi-2021-online-edition/dhsi-2021-online-edition-aligned-conferences-and-events/dhsi-2021-right-to-left/full-access/"},

In addition, this paper proposes a standard protocol with a set of metrics for measuring the effectiveness of Arabic optical character recognition (OCR) systems to assist researchers in comparing different Arabic OCR approaches. Design/methodology/approach This paper describes an experiment to automatically evaluate four well-known Arabic OCR systems using a set of performance metrics. The evaluation experiment is conducted on a publicly available printed Arabic dataset comprising 240 text images with a variety of resolution levels, font types, font styles and font sizes. Findings The experimental results show that the field of character recognition for printed Arabic still requires further research to reach an efficient text recognition method for Arabic script. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work that provides a comprehensive automated evaluation of Arabic OCR systems with respect to the characteristics of Arabic script and, in addition, proposes an evaluation methodology that can be used as a benchmark by researchers and therefore will contribute significantly to the enhancement of the field of Arabic script recognition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Alghamdi","given":"Mansoor"},{"family":"Teahan","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"Alghamdi.Teahan+2017+ExperimentalEvaluationArabic","container-title":"PSU Research Review","DOI":"10/gh4457","ISSN":"2399-1747","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"note":"https://web.archive.org/web/20210902092554/https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/PRR-05-2017-0026/full/html","number":"3","page":"229-241","publisher":"Emerald Publishing Limited","source":"Emerald Insight","title":"Experimental evaluation of Arabic OCR systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1108/PRR-05-2017-0026","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"Alkabani2020Sexualitynationalismother","abstract":"This article examines the dual and paradoxical conception of the Arabic literary canon in Orientalist and Nahḍa discourses in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries—an era of great change and closer mutual cultural awareness between Europe and the Arab world. What Arabic literature had long signified to European scholars since Antoine Galland’s eighteenth-century translation of The Arabian Nights (mysticism, Romanticism and a platform to explore sexual taboos) was very different from how the nationalist-minded Nahḍa intellectuals wanted to reconfigure it as the hallmark of the rational “Golden Age” of Arab civilization. Sexuality became a site of contestation between certain Orientalists who praised Arab literary “frankness” and an anxious class of Arab scholars who wanted to “cleanse” the Arabic literary canon and reconfigure it in line with modern, European standards of “respectability” and “politeness.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Alkabani","given":"Feras"}],"citation-key":"Alkabani2020Sexualitynationalismother","container-title":"Middle Eastern Literatures","DOI":"10/gkr935","ISSN":"1475-262X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,1]]},"page":"111-139","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Sexuality, nationalism and the other: the Arabic literary canon between Orientalism and the Nahḍa discourse at the fin de siècle","title-short":"Sexuality, nationalism and the other","type":"article-journal","URL":"10/gkr935","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"AlSabagh.Wrisley+2021+ArabicHandwrittenVernacular","abstract":"Whereas one might say that digitization practices of archival materials in Arab countries have lagged behind those Euro-American institutions, institutional digital archives most certainly do exist (notable examples are the QDL, AUC or AUB). Beyond these institutional archives, one finds many examples of private curatorial projects in Arab countries with documents hosted on privately-run self-publishing platforms, or even for sale on social media. For the purposes of our paper, we call these vernacular archives. Our paper takes a different approach from thinking about the possibilities of digital methods in institutional archives in formation (Bauer/Wrisley), instead addressing the possibilities, benefits, challenges of working with vernacular online archives from the Gulf region. On the one hand, we also situate them, within post-custodial archival practice (Ham) and discussions of the private archive (Fisher), and on the other, we argue that while such archives fall outside of traditional academic contexts, they are, in effect, a gray literature from within Arab countries that can benefit digital research (Paez; Holmen & Eide). These already digitized private archival materials are a practical starting point for digital historical research, but not without a number of challenges. In our presentation we discuss two ways of “doing DH” with such vernacular archives, in particular, al-Wathaeq (“documents,” in English), a collection of roughly 1,800 business letters of the Al Matrook family from 1920s Kuwait, currently hosted in WordPress. Building on preliminary research done on automatic transcription of right-to-left languages, we discuss work with HTR done on this archive as well as Twitter data of vernacular historians in the Gulf.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"AlSabagh","given":"Munther"},{"family":"Wrisley","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"AlSabagh.Wrisley+2021+ArabicHandwrittenVernacular","event-place":"Online","event-title":"DHSI 2021: Right to Left","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,8]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"Arabic Handwritten Vernacular Archives from the Gulf Region: Challenges and Opportunities for Local Digital History","type":"speech","URL":"https://dhsi.org/dhsi-2021-online-edition/dhsi-2021-online-edition-aligned-conferences-and-events/dhsi-2021-right-to-left/full-access/"},

While there is no paucity of papers about the “world-class” museums in nearby Abu Dhabi and their roles in shaping a national identity (Ajana, McClellan, Ouroussoff), rarely do we see critics engage with the home-grown institutions that make up Sharjah’s cultural landscape. In my presentation, I argue that using geospatial artwork data from the Sharjah Biennial, a contemporary art exhibition held in Sharjah, offers a unique path to visualizing the rapid spatial growth of this exhibition and the impact of its spatiality on local residents. In my talk, I will retrace the history of the Sharjah Biennial, discuss the layout of the exhibitions using catalogue-generated maps, and consider the impact of governmental support for cultural and artistic institutions in Sharjah. In addition, I will reflect on my methods of data collection, challenges in working with bilingual exhibition catalogues, and the use of mapping tools to represent spaces in the Arabian Peninsula.

  {"id":"Antoun.etal2021AraBERTTransformerbasedModel","abstract":"The Arabic language is a morphologically rich language with relatively few resources and a less explored syntax compared to English. Given these limitations, Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like Sentiment Analysis (SA), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Question Answering (QA), have proven to be very challenging to tackle. Recently, with the surge of transformers based models, language-specific BERT based models have proven to be very efficient at language understanding, provided they are pre-trained on a very large corpus. Such models were able to set new standards and achieve state-of-the-art results for most NLP tasks. In this paper, we pre-trained BERT specifically for the Arabic language in the pursuit of achieving the same success that BERT did for the English language. The performance of AraBERT is compared to multilingual BERT from Google and other state-of-the-art approaches. The results showed that the newly developed AraBERT achieved state-of-the-art performance on most tested Arabic NLP tasks.

  {"id":"Asil2020thereLifeOutside","abstract":"This paper rethinks the inflow of Western ideas into the Ottoman Empire through the metaphor of ‘cultural translation,’ which conceives of ‘translators’ as active ‘negotiators’ rather than simple transmitters. These ‘translators and negotiators’ also defy the binary of advocates or rejectors of new ideas. This paper will focus on the reformist ulema as both ‘translators’ of the prestige of modern science and as ‘negotiators’ of scientific authority vis-à-vis religious authority. To depict the complexity of the process of translation and negotiation, I focus on the debate surrounding extraterrestrial life. Its largely speculative nature reveals the ideological assumptions of the negotiators. Unlike more concrete discussions, the debates surrounding extraterrestrial life reflect the complexity of the discursive and rhetorical aspects of nineteenth-century-Ottomans’ perception of European science, its prestige, and authority vis-à-vis Islam.\n\nSince the Copernican revolution, the belief in the multiplicity of habitable worlds spread such that by the end of the eighteenth century, life in other planets was almost taken for granted by the Western reading public. However, while belief in extraterrestrial life started to fade in the West from 1860s onwards, it continued to draw increasing attention among the Ottomans. Relevant articles on this issue appeared from the 1870s to 1920s in Ottoman popular journals such as Hadika, Ulum, Hikmet, Mahfil, Malumat, and Resimli Kitap.\n\nIn 1909, the issue of life outside earth received direct attention of the ulema in the pages of the prominent Islamist journal S?rat?müstakim, where two opposing religious scholars engaged into a fierce debate. The scientistic or progressivist one held that the Qur’an included verses on extraterrestrial life though authoritative exegetes failed to acknowledge them. The conservative one, however, rejected this position inasmuch as it attempted to question the authority of earlier prominent ulema. Obviously, such an attempt must have been based on strong reason and solid evidence. In their defenses, both the scientistic and the conservative scholars appealed to the traditional Islamic epistemology and methodology and adapted them to discuss a modern scientific issue, which renders the debate as a case that resonates with the metaphor of ‘translation’ of a ‘foreign’ debate into a ‘native’ one. This paper uses concepts of ‘translation’ and ‘negotiation’, to explain ways in which science, theology, and exegesis crosscut each other. The two seemingly contradictory positions functioned equally as two different modes of resisting cultural imperialism and Western supremacy.","author":[{"family":"Asil","given":"Ercüment"}],"citation-key":"Asil2020thereLifeOutside","event-place":"Online","event-title":"MESA Annual Meeting","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,5]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"Is there Life Outside Earth?: Negotiating Religious and Scientific Authority in Late Ottoman Periodicals","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"Auji+2020+VisualAmusementsPrintedImageryinNineteenthcenturyArabicPublications","abstract":"This paper examines the interplay between art, print culture, and entertainment by considering the important role that printed images—namely engraved portraits, landscapes, cityscapes, “exotic” imagery, and myriad other illustrations—as popular forms of visual amusement amongst Arabic-speaking residents of nineteenth-century eastern Mediterranean cities. New kinds of printed images, produced using a variety of technologies, began to increasingly appear in Arabic books and periodicals published at regional presses. Many of these engraved images appeared in literary-scientific journals that strove to popularize modern science and culture. These journals typified the regional nineteenth century conceptions of the arts and sciences as interconnected and universal fields of inquiry and exemplified what contemporary sources perceived of as the modern age. Through such journals, middle-class Arabic-speaking residents of Ottoman cities like Beirut and Cairo debated and promoted “modern” views on science, technology, art, history, and culture during the period of the Arab nahda. The earliest of these journals, printed in Beirut and Cairo from the 1870s onwards, included al-Jinan (The Gardens), al-Muqtataf (The Selections), and al-Hilal (The Crescent). While these journals focused on articles and reports, which were usually translated into Arabic from American, British, and French popular science and literary journals, these Arabic publications also featured engravings for popular consumption. The use of engraved blocks (from local and European sources) heralded new forms of visual literacy that altered customary views on pictorial representation. The printed images helped to turn Arabic periodicals into both visual compendiums of popularized encyclopedic knowledge and sites of pictorial entertainment for a general readership.\n\nScholars of Middle Eastern history locate these periodicals as important markers of regional perspectives on modernity, cultural progress, and social reform. However, while considerable attention is paid to these journals’ articles, their engravings remain largely unexplored. This paper will turn to a close analysis of these printed images as novel forms of visual entertainment and populist artistic expression at a time when other artistic practices, such as oil painting and photography, were gaining traction in the region. The study will also consider how such pictorial modes were being negotiated alongside the varied and shifting views on al-funun (the arts). These printed images thus allow for a consideration of how painting, photography, and printing were interconnected and what that meant for new perspectives on technology, popular entertainment, and visuality.","author":[{"family":"Auji","given":"Hala"}],"citation-key":"Auji+2020+VisualAmusementsPrintedImageryinNineteenthcenturyArabicPublications","event-place":"Online","event-title":"MESA Annual Meeting","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,15]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"Visual Amusements: Printed Imagery in Nineteenth-century Arabic Publications","type":"paper-conference"},

Pendant plus d’une décennie (1957–64 et 1967–70), Shi‘r fut un espace d’innovation et de circulation de poèmes inédits, d’études critiques et de traductions au plus près de la production contemporaine, et d’essais théoriques promouvant le modernisme naissant. Associée à la trépidante Beyrouth des années 1950–60, Shi‘r fut au centre d’un écosystème culturel qu’elle contribua à enrichir et à dynamiser grâce à ses jeudis, le prix Shi‘r, la maison d’édition Shi‘r, le magazine Adab et la galerie d’art Gallery One. Les séances du jeudi constituèrent pendant plus de sept ans (1957–64) un espace de réception ouvert aux poèmes inédits (lus, commentés, promus). La plateforme médiatique offerte aux jeudis par al-Nahar, parmi d’autres journaux libanais, permit au mouvement Shi‘r de clarifier davantage son message révolutionnaire et ses orientations modernistes, et de se défendre contre les attaques répétées d’intellectuels panarabes vigoureusement attachés aux conventions hérité oétique arabe.

For more than a decade (1957–64, and 1967–70), Shi‘r was a space of innovation and circulation for unpublished poems, critical reviews, and translations closely following contemporary production, and theoretical essays furthering the nascent modernism. Associated with the bustling Beirut of the 1950s and 1960s, Shi‘r was at the centre of a cultural ecosystem it contributed to enrich and dynamize thanks to its Thursday sessions, Shi‘r’s Prize, the publishing house Shi‘r, the review Adab and the art gallery Gallery One. Its Thursdays constituted for more than seven years (1957–64) a space of reception for unpublished poems (read, commented, promoted). The media platform offered to the Thursday sessions by al-Nahar, among other Lebanese newspapers, allowed the Shi‘r movement to both further clarify its revolutionary message, its modernist orientations, and defend itself against the repeated attacks of pan-Arab intellectuals strenuously attached to inherite poetic tradition.

  {"id":"Barakat+2021+AnnotationandTranscription","abstract":"Our paper will present experiences related to OpenGulf’s work with Arabic historical texts using Transkribus and Recogito. OpenGulf’s Historical Text Analysis team developed a workflow for annotating and extracting data from English texts using Recogito, and is modifying that workflow for RTL-language texts including Arabic, Ottoman Turkish, and Persian. This process is crucial for the project’s goals of presenting multilingual and interimperial perspectives on Gulf history and moving beyond the European visions of space, landscape, population and materiality that our work with LTR texts has provided. The paper will present our current workflow using Transkribus to train a machine learning model to recognize and transcribe non-digitized Arabic texts, and Recogito to identify and annotate named entities in already-digitized Arabic texts and texts that have been digitized through Transkribus. The paper will reflect on challenges we have faced using Transkribus for RTL-language texts and identifying named entities in Arabic and Ottoman Turkish using Recogito. We will highlight the ways in which platform design incorporates language-based assumptions and strategies for developing multilingual, bidirectional workflows. We will also discuss the challenges moving into a multilingual environment has presented for developing workflows that are accessible to student collaborators with different linguistic abilities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Barakat","given":"Nora"}],"citation-key":"Barakat+2021+AnnotationandTranscription","event-place":"Online","event-title":"DHSI 2021: Right to Left","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,8]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"Annotation and Transcription Platforms and Arabic Script Languages: Promises and Challenges","type":"speech","URL":"https://dhsi.org/dhsi-2021-online-edition/dhsi-2021-online-edition-aligned-conferences-and-events/dhsi-2021-right-to-left/full-access/"},

  {"id":"Bashkin2020DreamHellDream","abstract":"In this paper, I focus on a dream about poetry and politics. I look at pomes about dreams as connected to numerous and overlapping modern movements of Arabic literary and cultural renewal, which animated several Arab public spheres from the second half of the nineteenth century until the Second World War, and whose writers were interested in political theory, historical progress, and scientific innovation. These movements, I suggest, generated a new spatial thinking about modernity, reality and the afterlife. To do so, I present a close reading of a long poem written by Iraqi intellectual Jamil Sidqi al-Zahawi (1863-1936), Revolution in Hell (Thawra fi’l jahim, 1931). Zahawi was a fervent supporter of positivism, Darwinism and social Darwinism, and celebrated the role of science in the modern world in his works of poetry and prose, which circulated in Arabic and Ottoman journals in several regional languages (such as Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Kurdish). In Revolution in Hell, Zahawi depicts how he dreamt about a lengthy visit to underworld, where he meets Darwin, Hegel, Buchner, Spencer, Fichte, Huxley, Spinoza, Newton, Holbach, Renan, Rousseau, Voltaire, Zarathustra, al-Kindi, Ibn Sina, Ibn Rushd, Abu Nuwas, Omar Khayyam (amongst others), as well as Dante and Abu ‘Ala al-Ma‘arri. Together, they devise modern machinery that allows them to conquer the Heavens. In my analysis of the poem, I reflect on the ways in which it captures many of contemporary narratives about the power of the science and explore how Zahawi subverts religious imagery related to Islamic cosmology in order to create a new understanding of a modern and new world. The presentation of these politics as a dream, however, subverts their radicalism. I further argue that the translation of both scientific and literary works into Middle Eastern languages enabled this conceptual and spatial shift with respect to Islamic cosmology.","author":[{"family":"Bashkin","given":"Orit"}],"citation-key":"Bashkin2020DreamHellDream","event-place":"Online","event-title":"MESA Annual Meeting","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,6]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"A Dream about Hell, A Dream about Freedom- Zahawi's Rebellion in Hell","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"BergamaschiEtAl2022Novel","abstract":"The linguistic and social impact of multiculturalism can no longer be neglected in any sector, creating the urgent need of creating systems and procedures for managing and sharing cultural heritages in both supranational and multi-literate contexts. In order to achieve this goal, text sensing appears to be one of the most crucial research areas. The long-term objective of the DigitalMaktaba project, born from interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists, historians, librarians, engineers and linguists, is to establish procedures for the creation, management and cataloguing of archival heritage in non-Latin alphabets. In this paper, we discuss the currently ongoing design of an innovative workflow and tool in the area of text sensing, for the automatic extraction of knowledge and cataloguing of documents written in non-Latin languages (Arabic, Persian and Azerbaijani). The current prototype leverages different OCR, text processing and information extraction techniques in order to provide both a highly accurate extracted text and rich metadata content (including automatically identified cataloguing metadata), overcoming typical limitations of current state of the art approaches. The initial tests provide promising results. The paper includes a discussion of future steps (e.g., AI-based techniques further leveraging the extracted data/metadata and making the system learn from user feedback) and of the many foreseen advantages of this research, both from a technical and a broader cultural-preservation and sharing point of view.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Bergamaschi","given":"Sonia"},{"family":"De Nardis","given":"Stefania"},{"family":"Martoglia","given":"Riccardo"},{"family":"Ruozzi","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Sala","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Vanzini","given":"Matteo"},{"family":"Vigliermo","given":"Riccardo Amerigo"}],"citation-key":"BergamaschiEtAl2022Novel","container-title":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s22113995","ISSN":"1424-8220","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY 3.0","note":"date_read: 2023-09-14","page":"3995","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Novel Perspectives for the Management of Multilingual and Multialphabetic Heritages through Automatic Knowledge Extraction: The DigitalMaktaba Approach","title-short":"Novel Perspectives","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/3995","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"BitarafanEtAl2019Controversyconceptfreedom","abstract":"The Iranian constitutional revolution of 1906–09 paved the way for the establishment of new administrative institutions, adopting modern ideas and the hegemony of new political discourse over the archaic political reasoning. One of the most important aspects of the new discourse was the definition and internalization of modern concepts. This paper holds the view that the concept ‘freedom’ brought about a complicated problem for the socio-political sphere in the course of the Iranian revolution and, as such, deserves a thorough examination. Previous studies on the subject have usually neglected this aspect. Yet, this was exactly the main domain of the clash between traditionalism and modernity during the revolutionary years and brought about far-reaching results for Iranian society. This article attempts to contribute to this field by examining a number of Iranian journals of the period in order to evaluate their understanding of the concept ‘freedom’ and show the discrepancy between the constitutionalist and non-constitutionalist discourses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Bitarafan","given":"Mohammad"},{"family":"Yazdani","given":"Sohrab"},{"family":"Sheiban","given":"Hossein"}],"citation-key":"BitarafanEtAl2019Controversyconceptfreedom","container-title":"British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies","DOI":"10/gcprj6","ISSN":"1353-0194","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,1]]},"page":"1-13","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Controversy over the concept ‘freedom’ during the Iranian constitutional revolution (1906– 09)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13530194.2017.1361316","volume":"46"},

Food riots were adaptable responses to emergencies and felt abuses, not the defense of a customary anti-capitalist economy or ideology. Further advances in understanding food riots will be made not by emphasizing static common factors, but by attempting to explain varieties of riot behavior in terms of different contexts, as food riots rose and fell over two centuries, as policies and riot politics differed between Britain and France, and as the matrices of provision politics changed from one community or region to another.","author":[{"family":"Bohstedt","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"Bohstedt+1992","container-title":"Journal of Social History","DOI":"10.2307/3788421","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992"]]},"language":"en","note":"uuid: 8A395C56-5E35-4189-A60E-BD604FB09E02","number":"2","page":"pp. 265-284","publisher":"Peter N.

Unlike previous studies, this book steps outside disciplinary and regional boundaries and provides a typological cross-cultural comparison of standardisation processes in twelve Arabic-influenced writing traditions where different cultures, languages and scripts interact. A wide range of case studies give insights into the factors behind uniformity and variation in Judeo-Arabic in Hebrew script, South Palestinian Christian Arabic, New Persian, Aljamiado of the Spanish Moriscos, Ottoman Turkish, a single multilingual Ottoman manuscript, Sino-Arabic in northwest China, Malay Jawi in the Moluccas, Kanuri and Hausa in Nigeria, Kabyle in Algeria, and Ethiopian Fidäl script as used to transliterate Arabic. One of the findings of this volume is that different domains of manuscript cultures have distinct paths of standardisation, so that orthography tends to develop its own standardisation principles irrespective of norms applied to layout and script types.

In this paper, we argue that eponyms are a promising way to explore historic relationships between natural scientists using taxonomy. Our empirical case is the emerging community of malacologists in the 19th century. Along the lines of pivotal concepts of social network analysis we interpret eponyms as immaterial goods that resemble the properties of regular social contacts. Utilising Exponential Random Graph Models reveals that the social exchange underlying eponyms follows similar rules as other social relationships such as friendships or collaborations. It is generally characterized by network endogenous structures and homophily. Interestingly, the productivity of authors seems to be well recognised among contemporary researchers and increases the probability of a tie within the network significantly. In addition, we observe an epistemological divide in the malacological research community. Thus even in the 19th century, at a time when science was just emerging as a differentiated social system, epistemological distinctions have been a defining concept for scientific contacts.","author":[{"family":"Breure","given":"Abraham S.H."},{"family":"Heiberger","given":"Raphael H."}],"citation-key":"BreureHeiberger2019Reconstructingsciencenetworks","container-title":"Journal of Historical Network Research","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"92-117","title":"Reconstructing science networks from the past.

This article argues that producers of digital editions should assign meaningful version numbers to their editions and update those version numbers with each change, allowing both humans and computers to know when resources have been modified and how significant the changes are. As an examination of versioning practices in the software industry reveals, version numbers are not neutral descriptors but social products intended for use in specific contexts, and the producers of digital editions must consider how version numbers will be used in developing numbering schemes. It may be beneficial to version different parts of an edition separately, and in particular to version the data objects or content of an edition independently from the environment in which it is displayed. The article concludes with a case study of the development of a versioning policy for the Piers Plowman Electronic Archive, and includes an appendix surveying how a selection of digital editions handle the problem of recording and communicating changes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Broyles","given":"Paul A."}],"citation-key":"Broyles+2020+DigitalEditionsAnd","container-title":"Digital Humanities Quarterly","container-title-short":"DHQ","DOI":"10.17613/bde5-rp28","ISSN":"1938-4122","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en-US","license":"CC BY-ND 4.0","note":"https://web.archive.org/web/20210913132015/https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:38103/","publisher":"Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations","source":"hcommons.org","title":"Digital Editions and Version Numbering","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/2/000455/000455.html","volume":"14"},

While Afrofuturism has thus far been discussed through a literary, artistic, or popular culture lens, growing use of new technologies, and its resultant intersections with the reality of our racial experiences, has created a need for approaching Afrofuturism from a digital studies perspective.

  {"id":"Chitanana2019GlobalLocalMetropolitan","abstract":"This study argues for a def initional and contextual approach to examining the digital divide in its theoretical and practical sense. Such an approach narrows the foundational theoretical ideas and practical experiences from a global to a local perspective, placing the emphasis on meanings rooted in local knowledge rather than ‘set’ standards. The chapter uses the transformative role of mobile phones in Zimbabwe, and a secondary review of digital divide literature, to demonstrate the disconnect between global perspectives of the divide and the local experiences from urban and rural Zimbabwe. In addition to the definitional and contextual arguments, a basic political-economy approach is applied to the discourse around access, or lack of access, to digital technologies and the meaning of the digital divide in Zimbabwe. This underpins the chapter’s reflection on entrenched power dynamics and inequalities that magnify and perpetuate the divide. The chapter argues that, to get a better sense of digital divide, access and utilisation of ICTs should be assessed with an equitable consideration of the individuals’ needs, depending on their social, political, and economic contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Chitanana","given":"Tenford"}],"citation-key":"Chitanana2019GlobalLocalMetropolitan","container-title":"Mapping Digital Divide in Africa: A Mediated Analysis","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctvh4zj72","editor":[{"family":"Mutsvairo","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Ragnedda","given":"Massimo"}],"event-place":"Amsterdam","ISBN":"978-90-485-3822-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,20]]},"language":"en","page":"45-64","publisher":"Amsterdam University Press","publisher-place":"Amsterdam","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"From Global to Local, Metropolitan to Village: A Case for a Definitional and Context-Oriented Approach to Examining the ‘Digital Divide’","type":"chapter","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/j.ctvh4zj72"},

Using case studies, Crymble merges histories and philosophies of the field, separating issues relevant to historians from activities in the broader digital humanities movement. Key themes include the origin myths of digital historical research; a history of mass digitization of sources; how technology influenced changes in the curriculum; a portrait of the self-learning system that trains historians and the problems with that system; how blogs became a part of outreach and academic writing; and a roadmap for the continuing study of history in the digital era.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Crymble","given":"Adam"}],"call-number":"NB 2800 C957","citation-key":"Crymble2021Technology","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"University of Illinois Press","source":"HU Grimm-Zentrum","title":"Technology and the Historian: Transformations in the Digital Age","type":"book","URL":"https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p085697"},

  {"id":"DuganMontpellier2021MultipleScripts","abstract":"This paper outlines our methodology for regularizing the transliteration of Urdu-based discourse in digital spaces for analysis with various DH methods. Scholars, acknowledging social media as an increasingly central discursive space and the irregularity of Urdu-based online transliterations, have taken generative steps in this regard (Irvine and Ann 2012, Sharf and Ur Rahman 2017). At the same time, these methods require substantial technical knowledge and do not account for English words or Arabic-based Islamic expressions (e.g. ما شاء الله) and their variants (e.g. mashAllah, ma sha’ Allah, mash’Allah, mA, etc.). This paper advocates the use of spreadsheet applications as an accessible and adaptable tool for regularizing variability in language, script, and orthographic practices in Urdu-based social media discourse. Drawing from challenges faced in our respective research projects, we focus on a small set of piously affective terms and phrases that highlight the applicability of this work for DH projects in Muslim digital worlds. The paper argues that shortening the technical learning curve improves the robustness of DH work with RTL languages, particularly in social media spaces. We elaborate how regularizing orthographic variability in the digital culture in Islamic South Asia and its diasporas widens the analytical scope for scholars working with multiscript, polylingual, and religiously-inflected datasets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Dugan","given":"Max"},{"family":"Montpellier","given":"Elliot"}],"citation-key":"DuganMontpellier2021MultipleScripts","event-place":"Online","event-title":"DHSI 2021: Right to Left","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,8]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"Multiple Scripts: Regularizing Social Media Discourse in Urdu and its (Many) Transliterations","type":"speech","URL":"https://dhsi.org/dhsi-2021-online-edition/dhsi-2021-online-edition-aligned-conferences-and-events/dhsi-2021-right-to-left/full-access/"},
  {"id":"DuPreez2018VoicesSouth","abstract":"This volume captures the status of digital humanities within the Arts in South Africa. The primary research methodology falls within the broader tradition of phenomenological hermeneutics, with a specific emphasis on visual hermeneutics. Some of the tools utilised as part of the visual hermeneutic methods are geographic information system (GIS) mapping, sensory ethnography and narrative pathways. Digital humanities is positioned here as the necessary engagement of the humanities with the pervasive digital culture of the 21st century. It is posited that the humanities and arts, in particular, have an essential role to play in unlocking meaning from scientific, technological and data-driven research. The critical engagement with digital humanities is foregrounded throughout the volume, as this crucial engagement works through images. Images (as understood within image studies) are not merely another form of text but always more than text. As such, this book is the first of its kind in the South African scholarly landscape, and notably also a first on the African continent. Its targeted audience include both scholars within the humanities, particularly in the arts and social sciences. Researchers pursuing the new field of digital humanities may also find the ideas presented in this book significant. Several of the chapters analyse the question of dealing with digital humanities through representations of the self as viewed from the Global South. However, it should be noted that self-representation is not the only area covered in this volume.

It examines the imaginations that interwove representations of the German imperial self, apparent in visual and textual artefacts in the archival material of the German air force mission, as well as in the academic and institutional work of German Protestant theologian and Orientalist Gustav Dalman (1855–1941). The author shows how two aspects (the secular and the religious) of the German mission civilisatrice, the ideological backbone of its colonial ambitions, are reflected in the ways that the imagery of Palestine is created and connected within the struggle for power in the Near East. The author argues that the German secular mission went hand in hand with its aspirations to evangelize the Orient. The religious mission is evident in the aspirations of Dalman’s social milieu by interpreting modernity against the background of biblical salvation history as the “end of times.” In this regard, Palestine was perceived as both: a place of salvation history as well as a power and culturalpolitical influence zone.","author":[{"family":"Bulbeisi","given":"Sarah","non-dropping-particle":"el"}],"citation-key":"ElBulbeisi2020PalestineImaginationImperial","container-title":"Jerusalem Quarterly","issue":"77-86","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"10","source":"Zotero","title":"Palestine in the Imagination of the Imperial German Self: Gustav Dalman and the Bavarian War Archive","type":"article-journal"},

Warez: The Infrastructure and Aesthetics of Piracy is the first scholarly research book about this underground subculture, which began life in the pre-internet era Bulletin Board Systems and moved to internet File Transfer Protocol servers (“topsites\") in the mid- to late-1990s. The “Scene,\" as it is known, is highly illegal in almost every aspect of its operations. The term “Warez\" itself refers to pirated media, a derivative of “software.\" Taking a deep dive in the documentary evidence produced by the Scene itself, Warez describes the operations and infrastructures an underground culture with its own norms and rules of participation, its own forms of sociality, and its own artistic forms. Even though forms of digital piracy are often framed within ideological terms of equal access to knowledge and culture, Eve uncovers in the Warez Scene a culture of competitive ranking and one-upmanship that is at odds with the often communalist interpretations of piracy.

As the National Bibliographic Service catalogue (SBN) does not yet manage data in non-Latin scripts, the aim of DREAM is to offer researchers a catalogue searchable through original scripts (such as Arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic, etc.). One of the most remarkable features of the project is the creation of an ILS-independent working context in which the cataloguer may !nd and retrieve data in original script from authoritative catalogues, starting from the existing romanized ones. From a technical standpoint, the ever increasing Unicode support offered by modern operating systems, DBMSs and indexing engines makes the rapid development of the relevant software tools a concrete possibility. This in turn implies a shift in scienti!c focus towards the (often subtle) record linkage operations between different data sources.

  {"id":"Fossestol2020TranslationLateOttoman","abstract":"What role did translation of fiction and drama play in Teodor Kasap’s periodicals? How were translated texts received, used, and discussed? Most studies consider translations as disconnected from the environment in which they appeared. By contrast, I propose to study them as part of the entity constituted by the periodic press. My aim in this paper is to frame Kasap’s translations and interest with translation within a larger framework of late Ottoman translation. Departing from Micromégas and translated dramatic texts, I will provide a novel perspective on the late Ottoman public sphere, the way it worked, and not least, the role and function of translation within it.\nDiyojen, Ç?ng?rakl? Tatar, and Hayal, the satirical periodicals edited by Teodor Kasap in the 1870s, are among the most interesting publications at the time. As Madeleine Elfenbein (2017) convincingly argues, Kasap’s vision was Ottomanist. He aimed at gathering all Ottoman subjects, independent of religious, ethnic and cultural background. His main device was the press, and his periodicals are extremely rich sources: Kasap draws on the manifold and multilingual Ottoman print culture in order to propagate for his ideas. However, the way in which his translations contributed to shaping the public sphere remains understudied. Voltaire’s science fiction novella Micromégas started to appear in Ottoman translation in Diyojen in October 1871. The translator was Teodor Kasap himself. In the foreword to the translation, he praises Voltaire’s fearlessness faced with state authorities, and emphasizes his criticism of power, oppression, as well as his illustrious strength of mind. Ottoman society needed these insights, according to Kasap. Micromégas is not the only example of translation in Kasap’s publications: His interest with French drama, and their Ottoman translations, is of major significance in both Diyojen, Ç?ng?rakl? Tatar, and later Hayal.\nMy paper cuts across social history, intellectual history, and literary studies: I investigate how the circulation of cultural products raised debates about language, society and identity. Kasap’s translation endeavors serve as brilliant examples. Late Ottoman writers, journalists, and readers strived to carve out an intellectual space able to house the rapidly changing cultural, social, and political circumstances. Translated fiction became parts of ongoing debates; they contributed to launch them, being both enriching, challenging, and in some cases even limiting.","author":[{"family":"Fossestøl","given":"Ingeborg"}],"citation-key":"Fossestol2020TranslationLateOttoman","event-place":"Online","event-title":"MESA Annual Meeting","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,6]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"Translation and the Late Ottoman Public: The Role of Translated Fiction in Teodor Kasap’s Satirical Periodicals","type":"paper-conference"},

From the tenth to the early twentieth century, dozens of Muslim exegetes, travellers and chroniclers explained that Ramla and Palestine were the same place. Others thought Palestine was a small region based around Ramla, one that did not include Jerusalem, or that Palestine had much more to do with Ramla than it did Jerusalem. The association had much to do with the cultural tendency in the Arab Middle East to conflate cities and regions as well as the critical role Ramla played in Palestine for much of its history: it served as the capital of the District of Palestine for more than three centuries, its economic hub for many more and its imagined geographical centre up until the early nineteenth century.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Foster","given":"Zachary J."}],"citation-key":"Foster2016WasJerusalemPart","container-title":"British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies","DOI":"10/gg8fx3","ISSN":"1353-0194","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",10,1]]},"page":"575-589","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Was Jerusalem Part of Palestine?

  {"id":"Frdws2016lwSwllHrllmaalwmt","abstract":"يعد الوصول للمعرفة مطلبا جوهريا لمختلف جوانب التنمية البشرية ، ابتداء من الصحة والتعليم إلى تحقيق الأمن الغذائي، وتشييد القدرات والبنية الاجتماعية، ورغم ذلك فهناك عدد من القيود والعقبات التي تحول دون الوصول إلى المعرفة من خلال المنشورات العلمية الأكاديمية في جميع أنحاء العالم وخاصة في البلدان النامية وتتمثل تلك القيود والعقبات بشكل أساسي في التزايد المستمر لأسعار الدوريات العلمية التي أصبحت حكرا على مؤسسات ودور النشر الكبرى، وعجز القدرات الشرائية للمكتبات البحثية والجامعية على ملاحقتها. الأمر الذي أدى إلى بزوغ حركة الوصول الحر للمعلومات Open Access Movement   والدعوة إليها والمناداة بها كأحد أساليب الاتصال العلمي بين الباحثين من خلال الوصول للإنتاج الفكري العلمي وتحريره من تلك القيود دون مقابل مادي وبحد أدنى من القيود القانونية ؛ للتخفيف من وطأة عدم الوصول للمعرفة وخاصة في المجالات العلمية المتحركة من خلال آليتين أساسيتين هما الدوريات المجانية Open Access Journal والمستودعات الرقمية المفتوحة  Open Access  Repository التي تعد محور الدراسة الحالية. لتتعايش وتتكامل هذه الآليات جنبا إلى جنب مع وسائل النشر التقليدية دون منافسة أو تقويض لها. \nوتحاول هذه الورقة البحثية  إلقاء الضوء على المحاور الرئيسة لحركة الوصول الحر للمعلومات، فتتعرض لتعريفاتها وتشير إلى أهم المبادرات والبيانات التي دعت إليها، ثم تتطرق إلى نشأة المستودعات الرقمية المفتوحة سواء الموضوعية منها أوالمؤسسية، وتعريفها وأنواعها، وعوامل انتشارها، كما تشير من خلال ذلك للجهود السودانية فى دعم حركة الوصول الحر للمعلومات، ثم يختتم بالمشكلات والمعيقات التي تواجه حركة الوصول الحر للمعلومات بالجامعات وأهم التوصيات لحل هذه المشكلة. \nتعريف الوصول الحر للمعلومات :- \nأسهمت المبادرات والبيانات والإعلانات الدولية والمحلية والدراسات فى وضع تعريف الوصول الحر للمعلومات العلمية . لكن من أهمها التعريف الذى قدمته مبادرة بودابست Budapest Open Access Initiative فى ديسمبر2001م ، وبيان بيتسادا للوصول الحر The Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishingفى 2003 م الذي جاء مكملاً لتعريف مبادرة بودابست، وإعلان برلين Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities  في العام نفسه 2003 م ، كأول تحركات دولية حددت معالم مفهوم الوصول الحر للمعلومات العلمية وخصائصه وآلياته. \n\tثم توالت المبادرات والبيانات والإعلانات التي تؤكد الاتجاه نحو الوصول الحر للمعلومات العلمية وتؤيده، وفيما يأتي نستعرض تعريف هذه المبادرات الدولية الثلاث بشيء من التوضيح بوصفها أهم ما أسهم في تقديم تعريف للوصول الحر للمعلومات العلمية، وتعرف هذه المبادرات بالباءات الثلاثة (BBB)كما أطلق عليهم بيتر سوبر Peter Suber  أحد الرواد الأوائل المناصرين لحركة الوصول الحر للمعلومات. \n\tوفقاً لمبادرة بودابست يعرف الوصول الحر للمعلومات العلمية بأنه «إتاحة الإنتاج الفكري العلمي على الخط المباشر مجانا، متمثلا بشكل مبدئي في المقالات المحكمة المنشورة  Peer-reviewed journal articles ومسودات المقالات التي لم تحكم بعد، لجميع الدارسين على شبكة الإنترنت، والسماح لأي مستفيد منهم بالقراءة والتحميل الهابط والنسخ والتوزيع والطباعة والزحف إليها وتكشفيها من قبل أدوات البحث، لأي غرض قانوني دون قيود مادية أو قانونية أو تقنية، على أن ينسب العمل إلى صاحبه، وذلك من خلال آليتين هما الدوريات المجانية والأرشفة الذاتية Self-Archiving». \nويرىشارلز بايلي   Charles W. Baileyفى هذا التعريف الذى قدمته مبادرة بودابست أنه يشتمل على سبع نقاط أساسيةتوضح الإطار العام للوصول الحر للمعلومات العلمية هى: \n1.    إتاحة الإنتاج الفكري بالمجان. \n2.    إتاحته على الشبكة العنكوبتية العالمية. \n3.    يتضمن المقالات بشكل أساسي سواء كانت المقالات المحكمة أو غير المحكمة، ولا تقع القصص الرومانسية والمجلات والكتب الترفيهية تحت مظلة حركة الوصول الحر للمعلومات. \n4.    لا يحصل مؤلفو هذه الأعمال على مقابل مادي. \n5.    منح المستفيدين عدد من الصلاحيات والامتيازات غير العادية والتي سبق ذكرها فى التعريف. \n6.    حق نسبة الأعمال إلى أصحابها. \n7.    وجود آليتين للوصول الحر للمعلومات العلمية هما الدوريات المجانية والأرشفة الذاتية. \nأمابيان بيتسادا للوصول الحر The Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishingعام 2003 فقد أضاف بعض التفاصيل والآليات لتفعيل مفهوم الوصول الحر للمعلومات من خلال شرطين هما :- \n\tأن يمنح المؤلف أو صاحب حق الطبع والنشر جميع المستفيدين المجانية والحق الدائم بلا رجعة في إتاحة العمل والأعمال المشتقة منه والتصريح بطبعه وتوزيعه ونقله والعرض العلني له، في أي وسيط رقمي لأي غرض مسئول، مع حق المؤلف في نسبة العمل إليه، إلى جانب أحقيته فى طبع عدد صغير من النسخ للاستخدام الشخصي. \n\tإيداع الإصدارات الكاملة من الأعمال والأعمال الملحقة بها أو التكميلية  فور نشرها مع نسخة، من التصريح السابق ذكره فى شكل مناسب إلكترونيا، في مستودع واحد فقط على الأقل سواء دعمته مؤسسة أكاديمية أو المجتمع البحثي أو وكالة حكومية أو غيرها من المنظمات الراسخة التي تسعى لتمكين الوصول الحر للمعلومات دون قيد فى التوزيع، وأن تتمتع هذه المستودعات بالقدرة على التشغيل البيني  interoperability والأرشفة طويلة المدى  \n long-term archiving. \nورغم أن التعريف السابق الذي قدمه إعلان بيتسادا جاء مبنيا على التعريف الذي قدمته مبادرة بودابست، لكن لم يوضح تعريف مبادرة بودابست كيفية تفعيل مفهوم الوصول الحر من قبل المؤلف أو صاحب حق النشر ، وكيف للمستفيد أن يعرف أن العمل متاح وفقا لفلسفة الوصول الحر للمعلومات، بينما حدد خصائص تفعيل مفهوم الوصول الحر للمعلومات على النحو الآتي: \n-    حق المستفيد الدائم Perpetual في الوصول المجاني للعمل. \n-        إلحاق ترخيص بالعمل يوضح شروط الاستخدام وبنوده من قبل المؤلف أو صاحب حق النشر للمستفيدين . \n-        إمكانية اشتقاق أعمال أخرى من العمل كترجمة العمل لأحد اللغات دون الرجوع إلى المؤلف أو صاحب حق النشر. \n-        إيداع العمل في المستودعات الرقمية المفتوحة ذات الصفة المؤسسية مما يضمن له الحفظ طويل المدى . \nالمقومات والركائز لحركة الوصول الحر للمعلومات :- \nتستند حركة الوصول الحر للمعلومات العلمية على ثلاث ركائز أساسية هي: \n1.    المؤلفون :- \nوهم النخبة المبدعة من العلماء والدارسين الراغبين فى النشر والبحث للتأثير Impact Factor، وبث أعمالهم على نطاق واسع وليس سعيا وراء الربح المادي. وهذا ما تؤكده جمعية المكتبات البحثية  Association Research Library بأن الوصول الحر يعتمد على الأعمال التي تنشأ دون توقع لعائد مادي مباشر كمقالات الدوريات المحكمة ومسودات المقالات والبيانات الأولية ومجموعات البيانات Data Sets، إلى جانب المؤلفين القادرين على استرداد حق النشر ويوافقون على الوصول الحر للمعلومات، دون قيود قانونية لإيداعها سواء بالمستودعات المؤسسية أو المتخصصة الموضوعية. \n 2.    شبكة الإنترنت :- \nتتسم شبكة الإنترنت كوسيط يوزع نسخاً إفتراضية أنها توفر تلك الخدمة دون تكلفة على عاتق المستفيدين، وهو ما كان متعذراً حصوله في عصر الطباعة. \n3.    إخصائيو المكتبات :- \nيعد إخصائيو المكتبات الوسيط الأساسي بين المعلومات والمستفيدين منها، والذين يؤدون وظائف متعددة ابتداء من إعداد المصادر لتصبح جاهزة للأرشفة الذاتية ومعالجتها وإنتهاء بإتاحتها على شبكة الإنترنت. \nمزايا الوصول الحرللمعلومات :-  \nتوفر حركة الوصول الحر للمعلومات بشكل عام عدداً من المزايا للتغلب على العقبات السابق ذكرها، وإن كان التركيز على أزمة التصريح التي من شأنها تضييق الاستفادة من المتاح من الدوريات الالكترونية، وقد حصر «بيتر سوبر Peter Suber» هذه المميزات فى عشر مزايا ، والتي يمكن ردها جميعا إلى ثلاث نقاط ، هي:- \n1.  الملكية : وتعنى امتلاك المكتبات لنسخ من الدوريات الإلكترونية والرجوع للأعداد السابقة دون احتكار أو حجب من الناشرين. \n 2.  الحق الدائم في أرشفة أعداد الدوريات : دون تصريح خاص أو دفع قيمة دورية وإمكانية الحفظ طويل المدى والإتاحة دون الرجوع للناشرين. \n3.  الاستخدام والإتاحة : دون التقييد بكلمة سر أو IP address أو ساعات استخدام ، أو الانتساب لمؤسسة أو التقييد بالوجود بمكان معين. \nمعوقات الوصول الحر للمعلومات :- \nتكمن القيمة الأساسية التي يرتكز عليها مفهوم الوصول الحر للمعلومات وممارساته فى مد نطاق الوصول والإتاحة من خلال تخطى حواجز الترخيص والقيود المادية، لكن رغم تخطى تلك الحواجز والقيود فهناك قصور يحول دون الإتاحة العالمية الحقيقية  \n Truly Universal Access، ويتمثل ذلك القصور في أربعة معوقات هي :- \n1.    عوائق الإتاحة للمعاقين Access Barrier Handicap ، وذلك لأن معظم مواقع المستودعات والدوريات المجانية غير ملائمة من حيث التصميم لاحتياجات المستفيدين المعاقين. \n2.    القيود اللغوية : معظم الإنتاج الفكري متاح باللغة الانجليزية أو بلغة واحدة فقط، والترجمة الآلية مازالت تنطوي على كثير من القصور والضعف. \n3.    قيود الرقابة والتنقية  Filtering and Censorship barriers وتتمثل في الحد من الإتاحة وما يمكن الاطلاع عليه من قبل الكثير من المدارس والكليات والحكومات. \n4.    قيود الإتصال : Connectivity barriers والتى يعنى بها في الفجوة الرقمية التي تبعد بلايين البشر من بعض القارات التى قد تتضمن ملايين من الكليات الجادة عن التواصل مع الآخرين. \nولكي يتحقق الوصول الحر الكامل للمعلومات فلابد من التغلب على كل هذه المعوقات أو بعضها للوصول إلى الإتاحة الحقيقية للمنشورات العلمية للعالم كله. \n إستراتيجيات الوصول الحر للمعلومات :- \nتتمثل حركة الوصول الحر للمعلومات في إستراتجيتين أساسيتين لإتاحة الإنتاج الفكري العلمي، وكما سبق الإشارة كانت مبادرة بودابست أول مبادرة تدعو للوصول الحر للمعلومات ، وقد حددت آلياته في الآتي: \n1.    دوريات الوصول الحر :- Open Access Journal \n\tوهى الدوريات التى تتيح الوصول الحر للمقالات والبحوث دون مقابل مادي- أو ما يطلق عليها الطريق الذهبي Gold Road- وتسمح للمؤلفين باسترداد حقوق النشر الخاصة بهم، وبعض ناشري هذه الدوريات قد يكوّن مؤسسة غير ربحية كالمكتبة العامة للعلوم Public library of sciences ، أو مؤسسات ربحية مثل Biomed Central ، ويبلغ عدد دوريات الوصول الحر وفقا لدليل    Directory of open access journalsوالمعروف بـDOAJ5977 حتى يناير 2011م ما يقارب 496814 مقالا في جميع المجالات العلمية. \n2.    المستودعات الرقمية المفتوحةOpen Access Repository المستودعات الرقمية المفتوحة عبارة عن :- \n-  أحد أنواع قواعد البيانات المتاحة على الويب. \n-  تتيح النصف الكامل لأنواع متعددة من الإنتاج الفكري العلمي وبمختلف الأشكال من المواد الرقمية . \n- نموذج غير تجميعي للمقالات والبحوث. \n- تقبل مسودات المقالات غير المحكمة والمحكمة وتميز بينهما. \n- تتضمن المواد الأولية والثانوية ومواد الدرجة الثالثة من مصادر المعلومات. \n- تديرها أحد المؤسسات البحثية أو التعليمية أو اتحاد يتألف من مجموعة من المؤسسات البحثية أو التعليمية. \n- تزود بالإنتاج الفكري العلمي من خلال إيداع الباحثين بشكل تطوعي أو إلزامي أو كليهما معاً وفقاً لسياسة المؤسسة في حالة كونها مستودعات مؤسسية. \n-      تتيح الإنتاج الفكري العلمي بحد أدنى من القيود المادية والقانونية للمستفيدين سواء من داخل المؤسسة أو خارجها. \n-      لاتننتهك حقوق النشر للمؤلفين والناشرين . \n-      تختزن المواد وتنظمها وتبثها. \n-      تحفظ المواد حفظا طويل المدى. \n-    تتسم بالتراكمية والاستمرارية. \n-    تخدم الأغراض المهنية والتعليمية. \n-      تحكمها مجموعة من السياسات وخاصة فيما يتعلق بمسألة الإيداع وحقوق النشر. \n\t\tالمستودعات الرقمية - الوصول الحر للمعلومات البحثية والعلمية – السودان \n\t\tيعتبر السودان من أوائل الدول التي فعّلت مفهوم الوصول الحُر للمعلومات، من خلال مبادرات الكثير من الجامعات ومؤسسات المعلومات البحثية والعلمية، والتي بادرت بنشر أعداد هائلة من البحوث والدوريات والنشرات من خلال مواقع الإنترنت، ولكن تعتبر البداية الفعلية للوصول الحر للمعلومات في السودان بمعناه الحقيقي في إطار القوالب العلمية وبإستخدام أنظمة إدارة المحتوى    الرقمي المعيارية كانت مع بداية الألفية الحالية من خلال مجهودات مقدّرة لأعضاء منسقي منظمة إيفلElectronic Information for Libraries بالسودان من خلال عدد من المؤتمرات وورش العمل، ويعتبر مشروع أرشيف السودان المفتوح أول مشروع يهدف للوصول الحر للمعلومات العلمية والبحثية. \n\t\tومن ثم أنشأت الجمعية السودانية للمكتبات مستودعاً رقمياً متخصصاً في مجال المكتبات والمعلومات من خلال برمجية (قرين ستون)، ثم ظهر مفهوم الوصول الحر بالجامعة الأم في السودان من خلال دعم منظمة (إيفل) لمستودع كلية العلوم الرقمي في العام 2011م، وتعتبر مبادرة الوصول الحر للمعلومات العلمية والبحثية بين الجامعات (الخرطوم – النيلين – السودان) من المبادرات الهامة في مجال الوصول الحر للمعلومات بالسودان، حدث ذلك في العام 2012م بدعم من منظمة اليونسكو.  \n\tتركز إستراتيجية المشروع على تطوير السياسات وبناء القدرات، ووضع المعايير والشراكات والتعاون بين المؤسسات لترسيخ مبدأ الوصول الحر للمعلومات البحثية والعلمية بالسودان.   \nسياسات الوصول الحر للمعلومات البحثية والعلمية بالجامعات السودانية:  \n\tبالرغم من الأولية التي أولتها إدارات مؤسسات المعلومات مثل مراكز البحث العلمي، والجامعات للمستودعات الرقمية في السودان، إلاّ أن غياب السياسات الواضحة والمكتوبة تظل من المعوقات والمشكلات الحقيقية التي تواجه مبادرات الوصول الحر للمعلومات، ويظهر ذلك جليّاً من خلال تباين أنواع وأشكال مخرجات المستودعات الرقمية لمؤسسات موحّدة الأهداف مثل المكتبات الجامعية. وبالرغم من توافر كنوز مصادر المعرفة بتلك المؤسسات، إلاّ أنها تكتفي بعرض القليل جداً من هذا المحتوي، وهذا يدل على عدم التنسيق وغياب السياسات الإستراتيجية، والتي ينبغي أن تصدر من مؤسسات الدولة العليا من خلال خطة عمل تضع بنوداً واضحة تدعم تلك السياسات وتعمل على تطوير القدرات وشراكات التعاون. \n\t\tوتظهر مشكلات صياغة سياسات الوصول الحر للمعلومات من خلال عدم توحيد الجهات المناط بها صياغة تلك السياسات، فنجدها قد تشتّت بين الكثير من الإدارات والجهات المختلفة داخل المؤسسة الواحدة، فتارة تصدر عن المكتبات وتارة أخري تصدر من إدارات تقانة المعلومات وأخري تشكّل لها بعض اللجان الأخرى المؤقتة.  \nأنواع محتويات المستودعات الرقمية : -\t \n       تنوّعت أشكال مصادر وأوعية المعلومات لمستودعات الوصول الحر في السودان، وبما أن معظم تلك المشروعات انحصر في الجامعات لذلك كانت أوعية المعلومات في الكتب ومستخلصات الرسائل الجامعية والدوريات والنشرات والأوراق العلمية هي الأكثر ظهوراً وإتاحة في تلك المستودعات، إضافة للمحاضرات التي تنتجها تلك الجامعات وبعض ملخصات طلاب وأساتذة الجامعة، إضافة لبعض الكورسات المفتوحة المصدر، إلاّ أن هذا التنوّع لا يُعدّ كافياً خاصةً إذا ما نظرنا إلي الكَمْ الهائل من المعارف المتوفرة لدي تلك المؤسسات في أشكال مختلفة مثل الخرائط والمجسمات والوثائق التاريخية والعلمية، إضافة إلي غياب الكثير من المعلومات التي تعرف بأعضاء هيئة التدريس، والعلماء والمثقفين الذين يرفدون محيط الجامعات بالعديد من المعلومات العلمية. ومن الملاحظ الغياب التام للنشرات العلمية المتخصصة سواء بالجامعات أو بمراكز البحث العلمي. \n المشكلات التي تواجه مبادرات الوصول الحر للمعلومات بالجامعات السودانية :  \n  1/  نقص الوعي والإعلام الكافي :- \n\tتعاني الكثير من مؤسسات المعلومات والمستفيدين والباحثين من نقص الوعي بمفاهيم ومميزات الوصول الحر للمعلومات ، مما تتطلب الحاجة عقد المزيد من المؤتمرات وورش العمل التي تهدف لنشر الوعي بين الباحثين والمهتمين ، وكذلك مؤسسات ومراكز المعلومات للتعريف بأهمية تفعيل مبادرات الوصول الحر للمعلومات البحثية والعلمية التي تساعد على بناء مجتمع المعرفة. \n2/ حقوق الملكية الفكرية :- \n\tمعظم قوانين الملكية الفكرية حرصت على حماية حق المؤلف بغض النظر عن حماية حق المجتمع في الاستفادة من المعلومات العلمية والبحثية حتى وإن لم يستفيد المؤلف بأية حالة من مؤلفه سواء شكلاً أو مضموناً ، فظلت حقوق الملكية الفكرية داعمة للأفراد أكثر من المجتمعات التي أنتجت هؤلاء الأفراد ، وساهم بقدر كبير في نجاحه، فلم تساق حتى الآن قوانين تحمي الإنتاج العلمي والبحثي من خلال إتاحته للباحثين والمستفيدين لتنميته وتطويره إلاّ أن الأكثر من الجامعات حرصت في الفترة الأخيرة على أهمية نشر الإنتاج العلمي والمعرفي، وخاصة لأساتذة الجامعات وربطت ذلك بلوائح ترقيات أعضاء هيئة التدريس بإلزامهم بنشر الأوراق العلمية في مجالات علمية حكمة متاحة للجميع مما ساهم في نشر ثقافة الوصول الحر للمعلومات في السودان. \n 3/ تراكم المُنتج المعرفي: \n\tاهتمت الكثير من مؤسسات المعلومات في الآونة الأخيرة بنشر الإنتاج المعرفي، إلاّ أن تراكم المعلومات ومصادر المعلومات أصبح مشكلة حقيقية تواجه الكثير من المؤسسات مع ضعف الميزانيات وهجرة الكثير من الكوادر التقنية مع وجود كم هائل من مصادر المعلومات ذات القيمة العلمية في أشكال تقليدية تحتاج إلي لعمليات الرقمنة ومعالجات حتى تسهل عملية إتاحتها لجهور المستفيدين.  \nتوصلت الدراسة الى عدة نتائج أهمها :- \n- إن تجربة االوصول الحر للمعلومات بجامعة غرب كردفان قد حققت اهدافها المنشوده في خدمة البحث العلمي بالجامعة بصفه خاصة والمجتمع بصفه عامة . \n- إن مكتبات جامعة غرب كردفان باشتراكها في أنظمة المكتبات مفتوحة المصدر قد أحدثت تطورات هائله في خدماتها المعرفيه . \n- أسهم نظام البحث الالكتروني في تقديم خدمات للباحثين والبحث العلمي وللمختصين بصورة سريعة جدا . \n- تواجه المكتبات مشكلة التمويل الكافي فلابد للقائمين على الأمر السعى لحل هذه المشكلة .  \n-  وجود كم هائل من مصادر المعلومات ذات القيمة العلمية في أشكال تقليدية تحتاج إلي عمليات الرقمنة ومعالجات حتى تسهل عملية إتاحتها لجهور المستفيدين.  \n- عدم وجود المحتوي بالطريقة المثلي. \n- أغلب الإسطوانات  فارغة. \n-  رفض بعض الباحثين عرض موادهم بإعتبارها قابله للنشر مع العلم إن المحتوي الرقمي يحفظ كافة الحقوق الملكية لصاحب المادة. \n- تحويل المحتوى من تقليدي الى رقمي . \n- عدم توفر خدمة الانترنت في كثير من الأحيان بشكل مستمر بل احيانأ تنعدم الخدمة مما يعيق من تنفيذ التجربه بصوره مثلى . \n- النمو المطرد لأعداد المستودعات الرقمية جغرافيا ولغويا وموضوعيا وشكليا ، وأهم مقتنياتها الكيانات الرقمية من الإنتاج الفكري الأولى الذى يصعب الحصول عليه من مصادر أخرى . \n- الأرشفة الإلكترونية والحفظ الرقمى طويل الأمد والإتاحة العالمية ضمن مبادرات الوصول الحر للمعلومات هي أبرز الدوافع التي تقف وراء إنشاء المستودعات الرقمية . \n-  تشتمل المستودعات الرقمية فى تخصص المكتبات والمعلومات على العديد من السمات والخصائص المميزة التي تجعلها قناة اتصال علمى على درجة عالية من الكفاءة والجودة . \nالتوصيات :-  \n1/ تنسيق الجهود بين الجهات ذات الصلة لوضع إستراتيجية قومية ضمن أولوياتها صياغة سياسات واضحة للوصول الحر للمعلومات. \n2/ ترسيخ مفاهيم الوصول الحر بين الباحثين ومؤسسات المعلومات بعقد ورش العمل والتدورات التدريبية  والمؤتمرات ، ومحاولة إدراج تلك المفاهيم على مستوى المناهج الدراسية في تخصص المكتبتات والمعلومات.    \n3/ زيادة دعم البحث العلمي بمراكز البحث العلمي ومؤسسات المعلومات والمساهمة في تغطية متطلبات النشر الإلكتروني لتسهيل سبل الوصول الحر للمعلومات.  \n4/ رقمنة المكتبات الجامعية ودعم البرمجيات ومراكز الدعم الفني. \nمع اختصاصي المكتبات. IT5/ تعاون إختصاصي  الحاسوب  \nان يكون اختصاصي المكتبات بإعتباره هو المسؤول  الأول الذي يدير النظام. Administration6/ لابد  \n7/ ضرورة وجود مبرمج متدرب علي النظام ومفرداته يتبع إدارة المستودع الرقمي بعمادات المكتبات. \n8/ زيادة عدد العاملين بالنظام المتخصصين في المكتبات والمعلومات. \n9/ لا بد من  تكثيف الدورات التدريبية لمنسوبي المكتبات بالجامعات السودانية حتى يتسنى لهم التعامل مع الأنظمة بصورة سهله وسريعة. \n10/ يتحتم على القائمين على إدارة الجامعات ضرورة توفير الأجهزة والمعدات اللازمة للتشغيل.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,28]]},"author":[{"family":"فردوس","given":"عمر عثمان عبد الرحمن"}],"citation-key":"Frdws2016lwSwllHrllmaalwmt","genre":"Working Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",10,1]]},"language":"other","publisher":"جامعة غرب كردفان","source":"dspacewku.repository.edu.sd","title":"الوصول الحر للمعلومات البحثية والعلمية تجربة الجامعات السودانية","type":"report","URL":"http://localhost:8080/xmlui/handle/123456789/1465"},

  {"id":"Galloway2014CyberneticHypothesis","abstract":"Taking inspiration from Tiqqun’s 2001 text “The Cybernetic Hypothesis,” this essay examines the relationship between digital technology and scholarly research methods. A definition of the cybernetic hypothesis is presented by way of a series of historical investigations into the work of Lewis Richardson, Warren Weaver, John von Neumann, and Paul Otlet. Cybernetics is defined thus in terms of a broad set of assumptions and techniques influencing society and culture at large. These assumptions and techniques include an epistemology rooted in arrays or systems containing discrete entities, the organization of entities into systems, and the regularization of difference or asymmetry within the system overall. After having presented this view of cybernetics, the author examines the challenges and problems such a paradigm presents to scholarly research methods including contemporary developments in the digital humanities. These challenges and problems are grouped into two sets of terms: hegemony, recapitulation, and symmetry; and ideology, deskilling, and proletarianization. What kind of intellectual work is possible after the rise of digital media? Examining some aspects of contemporary technology and critical theory, this essay serves both as a meditation on the contemporary cybernetic world and as a proposal for what ought to be done about it.","author":[{"family":"Galloway","given":"Alexander R."}],"citation-key":"Galloway2014CyberneticHypothesis","container-title":"differences","DOI":"10/ggpbkc","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"107–131","publisher":"Duke University Press","source":"Google Scholar","title":"The cybernetic hypothesis","type":"article-journal","volume":"25"},

A recent project revisited the clustering of collected works that had been previously sidelined because of the challenges posed by their complexity. Attention was given to both the identification of collected works and to the determination of the component works within them. By extensively analysing cast-list information, performance notes, contents notes, titles, uniform titles and added entries, the contents of collected works could be identified and differentiated so that correct clustering was achieved. Further work is envisaged in the form of refining the tests and weights and also in the creation and use of name/title authority records and other knowledge cards in clustering. There is a requirement to link collected works with their component works for use in search and retrieval.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Gatenby","given":"Janifer"},{"family":"Thornburg","given":"Gail"},{"family":"Weitz","given":"Jay"},{"family":"OCLC","given":""}],"citation-key":"GatenbyEtAl2015CollectedWork","container-title":"The Code4Lib Journal","ISSN":"1940-5758","issue":"30","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,15]]},"source":"Code4Lib Journal","title":"Collected Work Clustering in WorldCat","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/10963"},

  {"id":"Gitelman2013RawData","abstract":"We live in the era of Big Data, with storage and transmission capacity measured not just in terabytes but in petabytes (where peta- denotes a quadrillion, or a thousand trillion). Data collection is constant and even insidious, with every click and every \"like\" stored somewhere for something. This book reminds us that data is anything but \"raw,\" that we shouldn't think of data as a natural resource but as a cultural one that needs to be generated, protected, and interpreted. The book's essays describe eight episodes in the history of data from the predigital to the digital. Together they address such issues as the ways that different kinds of data and different domains of inquiry are mutually defining; how data are variously \"cooked\" in the processes of their collection and use; and conflicts over what can -- or can't -- be \"reduced\" to data. Contributors discuss the intellectual history of data as a concept; describe early financial modeling and some unusual sources for astronomical data; discover the prehistory of the database in newspaper clippings and index cards; and consider contemporary \"dataveillance\" of our online habits as well as the complexity of scientific data curation.

  {"id":"Goikolea-Amiano2020BilingualismSignificant","abstract":"This essay surveys two largely disregarded bilingual (Arabic–Spanish) literary journals from late-colonial northern Morocco: Al-Motamid (1947–1956) and Ketama (1953–1959). I trace the process which led to the consolidation of the centrality of contemporary Arabic poetry in both journals, the practices and the actors which enabled it. As such, the essay is concerned not only with the project of (re)writing Moroccan Arabic literary history, but also the larger literary history connecting the Maghreb and the Mashreq, as well as Europe and Spanish and Arab diasporas in the Mahjar (North and South America). The essay also complicates understandings of local colonised culture and literature as necessarily subaltern and of literary translation moving from the literary “centre” to the “periphery,” allowing us instead to grasp the ways in which the Moroccan and Arab authors influenced the Spaniards. I argue the collaboration of the former, first in Al-Motamid and later in Ketama, was decisive for the increasingly bilingual and Arabic orientation that the journals adopted. In fact, one of the main goals of both journals became making modern Arabic literature available in Spanish. The Moroccan and other Arab writers also enabled the reorientation of some Spanish orientalists towards contemporary Arabic literary production. The journals made visible and enabled the circulation of contemporary Arabic poetry between the Mashreq, the Maghreb and the Mahjar literary worlds; of contemporary poetry between Arabic, Spanish, and other European languages. Although their location was the seemingly provincial Moroccan Spanish Protectorate, these journals became small but significant world literary nodes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Goikolea-Amiano","given":"Itzea"}],"citation-key":"Goikolea-Amiano2020BilingualismSignificant","container-title":"Interventions","DOI":"10/gkpsj2","ISSN":"1369-801X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,2]]},"page":"1-25","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Bilingualism and “Significant Geographies” in Moroccan Colonial Journals: Al-Motamid and Ketama, Modern Arabic Poetry and Literary History","title-short":"Bilingualism and “Significant Geographies” in Moroccan Colonial Journals","type":"article-journal","URL":"10/gkpsj2"},

  {"id":"GoldJosephs2019IntroductionDigital","abstract":"In this introduction to the digital humanities (DH), we will approach the field via a Caribbean Studies lens, exploring how an understanding of the digital based in the growing area of digital Caribbean studies might shape the larger field of DH.  The course aims to provide a landscape view of DH, paying attention to how its various approaches embody new ways of knowing and thinking, new epistemologies. What kinds of questions, for instance, does the practice of mapping pose to our research and teaching? How does the concept of mapping change when we begin from the Global South? When we attempt to share our work through social media, how is it changed and who do we imagine it reaches? How can we visually and ethically represent various forms of data and how does the data morph in the representation?  Over the course of this semester, we will explore these questions and others as we engage ongoing debates in the digital humanities, such as the problem of defining the digital humanities, the question of whether DH has (or needs) theoretical grounding, controversies over new models of peer review for digital scholarship, issues related to collaborative labor on digital projects, and the problematic questions surrounding research involving “big data.” The course will also emphasize the ways in which DH has helped transform the nature of academic teaching and pedagogy in the contemporary university with its emphasis on collaborative, student-centered and digital learning environments and approaches.  Central themes in the course will emerge from our focus on the Caribbean -- in particular, how various technologies and technical approaches have been shaped by colonial practices; how archives might be decolonized and how absences in the archives might be accounted for; and how concepts like minimal computing might alter the projects we build.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Gold","given":"Matthew K."},{"family":"Josephs","given":"Kelly"}],"citation-key":"GoldJosephs2019IntroductionDigital","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,25]]},"language":"en-US","source":"hcommons.org","title":"Introduction to Digital Humanities Syllabus","type":"manuscript","URL":"https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:31373/"},
  {"id":"Goldsmith2020Duchamp","abstract":"In 1996, during the relatively early days of the web, Kenneth Goldsmith created UbuWeb to post hard-to-find works of concrete\npoetry. What started out as a site to share works from a relatively obscure literary movement grew into an essential archive of\ntwentieth- and twenty-first-century avant-garde and experimental\nliterature, film, and music. Visitors around the world now have\naccess to both obscure and canonical works, from artists such as\nKara Walker, Yoko Ono, Pauline Oliveros, Samuel Beckett, Marcel\nDuchamp, Cecil Taylor, Glenn Ligon, William Burroughs, and Jean-Luc Godard.\n\n\n\nIn  <i>Duchamp Is My Lawyer</i> , Goldsmith tells the history of UbuWeb, explaining the motivations behind its creation and how\nartistic works are archived, consumed, and distributed online.\nBased on his own experiences and interviews with a variety of\nexperts, Goldsmith describes how the site navigates issues of\ncopyright and the ways that UbuWeb challenges familiar\nconfigurations and histories of the avant-garde. The book also\nportrays the growth of other \"shadow libraries\" and includes a\nsection on the artists whose works reflect the aims, aesthetics,\nand ethos of UbuWeb. Goldsmith concludes by contrasting UbuWeb's\ncommitment to the free-culture movement and giving access to a wide range of artistic works with today's gatekeepers of algorithmic\nculture, such as Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Goldsmith","given":"Kenneth"}],"citation-key":"Goldsmith2020Duchamp","DOI":"10.7312/gold18694","ISBN":"978-0-231-18694-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"publisher":"Columbia University Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"Duchamp Is My Lawyer: The Polemics, Pragmatics, and Poetics of UbuWeb","title-short":"Duchamp Is My Lawyer","type":"book","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/gold18694"},

  {"id":"Grallert+2021+OpenArabicPeriodical","abstract":"The proposed short paper introduces the project Open Arabic Periodical Editions (OpenArabicPE) as a case study of minimal computing to address the specific challenges and affordances of digital humanities in the Eastern Mediterranean. I will outline the socio-technical challenges for digital approaches to the cultural heritage of societies outside the Global North. I pose that a digital episteme deeply rooted in 20th-century, english-speaking, American neoliberal capitalism causes a neo-orientalist silencing of the material heritage of predominantly Arabic-speaking Islamicate societies. This places the onus of corpus building on individual scholars and citizens and requires mitigation strategies on every level of the digital workflow. Influenced by minimal computing and pirate care and based on the guiding principles of accessibility, simplicity, sustainability and credibility, OpenArabicPE originated in 2015 from an attempt to address the core problem of corpus building: the lack of functional Arabic OCR without which one would have to resort to human transcribers. Yet, we could produce reliable ground truth for improving and—with the advent of machine-learning based approaches—training OCR algorithms by combining existing transcriptions from shadow libraries, such as al-Maktaba al-Shāmila, with openly available digital facsimiles for the purpose of validating the former. The proposed paper will introduce the workflows to produce standard-compliant, machine-actionable, scholarly digital editions of Arabic periodicals by creatively repurposing open and free-to-use tools and platforms, which allow us to currently host full-text TEI XML editions of some 630 issues from six journals and more than 7 million words without any funding and resources beyond our own labour time and laptop computers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Grallert","given":"Till"}],"citation-key":"Grallert+2021+OpenArabicPeriodical","event-place":"Online","event-title":"DHSI 2021: Right to Left","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,8]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY 4.0","note":"slides: https://OpenArabicPE.github.io/slides/2021-dhsi/","publisher-place":"Online","title":"Open Arabic Periodical Editions: Contributing to the Digital Commons Without the Help We Cannot Get","type":"speech","URL":"https://dhsi.org/dhsi-2021-online-edition/dhsi-2021-online-edition-aligned-conferences-and-events/dhsi-2021-right-to-left/full-access/"},

It confronts hyperbolic promises of mass digitization and computational methods for the exploration of digitized cultural heritage as a hegemonic episteme rooted in 20th-century, English-speaking, neoliberal capitalism from the margins. OpenArabicPE is a framework for open, collaborative, and scholarly digital editions of early Arabic periodicals from the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean. It addresses the specific affordances of a historical multilingual society, whose material heritage continues to be looted, destroyed, and neglected; whose material heritage resists digitization efforts by being dependent on non-Latin scripts and, for instance, non-Gregorian calendars; and whose contemporary heirs cannot draw on the vast resources in wealth and socio-technical infrastructures of the Global North. Centered around generosity and minimal computing, OpenArabicPE is run by volunteers and currently hosts six editions with some 630 journal issues and more than 7 million words, without any funding, by re-purposing data, software, and infrastructures.","archive":"https://web.archive.org/web/20230302132915/http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000593/000593.html","author":[{"family":"Grallert","given":"Till"}],"citation-key":"Grallert2022DHQ","container-title":"Digital Humanities Quarterly","container-title-short":"DHQ","editor":[{"family":"Risam","given":"Roopika"},{"family":"Gil","given":"Alex"}],"issue":"2,  \"Minimal Computing\"","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,28]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY-ND 4.0","note":"QID: Q118629589","title":"Open Arabic Periodical Editions: A framework for bootstrapped scholarly editions outside the global north","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000593/000593.html","volume":"16"},

Although Majallat Rawdat al-ma‘arif was one of many school journals that paralleled the development of the daily press in Palestine, this journal sought a much more influential and serious role than other school journals by reflecting on issues of identity. Through discussions on Islam, Arabic language, and descriptions of trips made throughout Palestine, the journal articulated a set of complex and overlapping identities, from pan-Arabism, pan-Islamism, and local territorial nationalism. In addition, Majallat Rawdat al-ma‘arif rejected western culture by criticising the missionary school, and unlike the other school journals, most of which belonged to missionary schools, did not advertise western goods nor praise Jewish immigration and British colonialism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Greenberg","given":"Ela"}],"citation-key":"Greenberg2008MajallatRawdatalma","container-title":"British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies","DOI":"10/ffrv2r","ISSN":"1353-0194","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",4,1]]},"page":"79-95","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Majallat Rawdat al-ma‘arif: Constructing Identities within a Boys' School Journal in Mandatory Palestine","title-short":"Majallat Rawdat al-ma‘arif","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13530190801890261","volume":"35"},
  {"id":"Greene2020WorldBuildingNationSeeking","abstract":"The genre of the Arabic short story is often traced to several different roots. Yet, one of these origins can be evaluated as a genre of its own right—a genre of dream narratives (ru’ya). In Baghdad during the 1910s, several Muslim and Christian Arab intellectuals portrayed their hopes and fears for the future encapsulated within fictional prose dream narratives. While written in Arabic, they were composed in an environment that could not imagine a world without the Ottoman Empire. Moreover, while the goals of these texts were forward-looking, as dreams and visions imply, and some of these texts were even of a separatist nature, this paper argues that the spirit of these Iraqi ru’ya narratives should be examined within the Ottoman context.\n\nMy paper will identify the earlier Ottoman Turkish roots of this genre, Namik Kemal’s Rüya (\"The Dream\"), written while in exile in Chios in 1873 but only posthumously published in 1908. Ottoman-Iraqi Ma‘ruf al-Rusafi translated Namik Kemal’s Rüya into Arabic, and the dream narrative was published in Baghdad shortly thereafter. By linking to Namik Kemal and pointing to intra-imperial translation efforts to generate cultural production, I will demonstrate the Ottoman origins of this genre. Once Namik Kemal’s translated Rüya was printed in Baghdad, other writers began modifying the dream narrative genre in the Ottoman-Iraqi press. These writers of different confessional backgrounds created patriotic visions and built worlds set in dreamscapes in order to improve upon the current structures of state and society in the Ottoman Empire for Arab imperial citizens. I will analyze the themes raised in the dream narratives, such as Arabism, the nature of kingship, and morality, contrasting them to the disposition and the governance of the Ottoman Committee for Union and Progress (CUP).","author":[{"family":"Greene","given":"Annie"}],"citation-key":"Greene2020WorldBuildingNationSeeking","event-place":"Online","event-title":"MESA Annual Meeting","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,6]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"World-Building and Nation-Seeking in the Ottoman-Iraqi School of Dreams","type":"paper-conference"},

Grehan provides a lengthy account of the latter's argument, who quickly turned into an ardent supporter of tobacco and smoker himself refuting all sorts of religio-legal, political and health-based arguments.\n            His main argument is that the Ottoman debate on tobacco in the 17th century followed the path and employed the arguments of the debate around coffee some 100 years earlier. The legal authorities focused on issues of legality as intoxicants, questions of propriety, the get-together as institution fostering gambling and immoral behaviour etc. Further, he argues, tobacco was much faster and more widely adopted than coffee, as the tools for using it were much simpler and as the price was much lower, particularly for locally grown variants. The state soon started to regulate the trade instead of prohibiting it. \n            He makes an interesting point on the differences between bath houses and coffee houses (1375), arguing that the latter as a highly visible and audible place had a greater impact on the public sphere than the bath house that hid all activities behind walls and fog.","author":[{"family":"Grehan","given":"James"}],"citation-key":"Grehan+2006","container-title":"The American Historical Review","DOI":"10/dtgnf8","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",12]]},"language":"en","note":"uuid: 8972E294-1045-449D-BC21-34114E1F8B52","number":"5","page":"1352-1377","title":"Smoking and “Early Modern” Sociability: The Great Tobacco Debate in the Ottoman Middle East (Seventeenth to Eighteenth Centuries)","type":"article-journal","volume":"111"},

  {"id":"Gupta2022Right","abstract":"Academic research and publishing are facing a crisis. The importance of access to academic literature in an interconnected world, the ever-growing cost of subscriptions to this literature, different revenue models of journals, and reduced or stagnant library budgets are pushing the academic community to find alternatives for research publications. In its 25 years of existence, the Open Access Movement and models which sought to contain the crisis have become the subject of considerable criticism. At the same time, a significant portion of academic literature remains locked behind steep paywalls. This has led to the growth of pirate websites and shadow libraries, which have been met with forceful legal retribution by publishers using copyright laws. Using the Sci-Hub case, a current copyright infringement case brought by a group of publishers before the Delhi High Court, this Paper evaluates the Open Access Movement, fair dealing in copyright law, academic piracy, and court cases in the United States, India, and other countries within the broad meaning of the right to research. The Paper concludes that a purposive interpretation of copyright law may have an answer enabling a just outcome.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,25]]},"archive":"https://web.archive.org/web/20230425174333/https://jipel.law.nyu.edu/right-to-research-and-copyright-law-from-photocopying-to-shadow-libraries/","author":[{"family":"Mohan","given":"M.

  {"id":"Harrington2020OrphansInvalidsStrollers","abstract":"Sanayeh Garden was constructed in 1908 as a newly-built quarter of the Ottoman provincial capital of Beirut. It had, until the turn of the century, been an uninhabited expanse of dunes, notorious for frequently blowing sand into nearby neighborhoods and making inhabitants ill. The previous year, the Ottoman imperial government had opened a new vocational boarding school in this quarter to train poor, refugee, and orphaned children in traditional handcrafts and machine work and ensure their and the city’s future economic success. Its name in Turkish—sanayi mektebi, or industrial school—reflects the goals of imperial self-sufficiency and industrialization in the Late Ottoman period. Adjacent to the school and built simultaneously was Hamidiyye Hospital, named for the Ottoman sultan Abdülhamid II and intended to address the frequent and devastating cholera outbreaks that plagued Beirut. Both the vocational school and hospital were modern, global institutions that were realized physically in Beirut with features of eastern Mediterranean architecture—local stone, tiled roofs, oculi above rectangular windows, and porticos with thin columns separated by gothic arches. The school’s focus of industry was so pervasive that the garden in front of the two buildings and indeed the entire quarter came to be known as Sanayeh, which means industry in Arabic. As we can tell from photographs of the site, the garden was large and symmetrical, dotted with trees, lined with paths, and featured a bubbling fountain in the center, similar to contemporaneous gardens in major world cities. According to reformers of the era worldwide, such gardens with their greenery and fresh air were crucial to maintaining a healthy urban environment. Furthermore, public parks lent space to leisure activities such as strolls, which were particularly enjoyed by the emerging bourgeois class of Beirut.\n\nThrough analysis of photographic and written documentation of the park, school, and hospital, this paper explores the dichotomies of imperial/provincial, health/illness, sanitation/dirtiness, work/leisure, and middle/working class that permeated Sanayeh. Some questions it addresses are: how did Abdülhamid II construct a public image as a benefactor of the unfortunate through building a new school and hospital? To what extent did the architectural style of the two buildings project a modern Ottoman, Arab, and/or Beiruti identity? How was this reflected in the everyday life of the space, such as in the vocational school’s curriculum? Thus this paper will demonstrate how modern science, moral reform, and industrialization shaped this rare well-preserved Ottoman quarter of Beirut.","author":[{"family":"Harrington","given":"Lydia"}],"citation-key":"Harrington2020OrphansInvalidsStrollers","event-place":"Online","event-title":"MESA Annual Meeting","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,6]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"Orphans, Invalids, and Strollers: Constructing a mModern, Ottoman Square in Turn-of-the-Century Beirut","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"Isfahani+2021+ExpandingIslamicateDigital","abstract":"My seed project is a network analysis of Sufi orders and silsilah (lineages) locating them in space and time. I am using a number of different primary and secondary sources to collect, curate and finally visualize data that will help scholars of Sufism to recapture some of the structure and shape of its dynamic intellectual networks. Specifically, I am looking at the Sufi Naqshbandi order that has its roots in Bukhara in what is now Uzbekistan, starting from the Sufi saint, scholar and founder of the order Hazrat Khwaja Muhammad Baha’uddin Shah Naqshband (Algar), and spreading to South Asia. The Naqshbandi Sufi order exists today in many parts of the world through a network of variegated relationships. In effect, there are at least two attributes that stand out in my network analysis of the Naqshbandi Sufi order: the pedigree (of religious significance), and the master-disciple chain. Sufi orders have been neglected in the field of South Asian, Middle Eastern and Islamicate (Hodgson) digital humanities, and through my project I argue for the enormous potential they hold in furthering the study of the Islamicate world, specifically viz. the transmission and cross-fertilization of ideas. It is similar to the more popular Hadith studies scholarship, in so far as it looks at teacher-disciple transmissions called ‘citation networks,’ but that popularity is in large part because of the availability of extensive citations in comprehensive encyclopedias. Sufi orders, on the other hand, suffer from the\ndigital humanist’s neglect owing to the lack of OCRed Tazkirah (memorandum) texts. My project is therefore an effort towards bringing Sufism into the fold of digital humanities research, and creating opportunities to reframe research questions on Islamic intellectual networks from analogue to digital form.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Isfahani","given":"Wafa Fatima"}],"citation-key":"Isfahani+2021+ExpandingIslamicateDigital","event-place":"Online","event-title":"DHSI 2021: Right to Left","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,8]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"Expanding Islamicate Digital Humanities: A Network Analysis of the Sufi Naqshbandi Order","type":"speech","URL":"https://dhsi.org/dhsi-2021-online-edition/dhsi-2021-online-edition-aligned-conferences-and-events/dhsi-2021-right-to-left/full-access/"},

  {"id":"Jaquier2020DesertTracksHighways","abstract":"The historiography of the Syrian Desert—which covers parts of present-day Syria, Iraq, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia—generally considers this desert region as one that separates as much as it connects different territories. In the late Ottoman period, merchant caravans, Bedouins, pilgrims and other travellers regularly crossed the desert. Relying on these existing social and infrastructural networks, travellers made their way across the desert in greater numbers in the interwar period due to the spread of motorized transport. While a growing number of scholars have paid attention to regional patterns of mobility in the interwar Middle East, the development of a region-wide motor transport infrastructure remains understudied. This paper traces the beginnings of the Baghdad-Damascus route by examining the various components of the new transport system: automobiles, roads and tracks, transport companies, and government support. In doing so, it attempts to examine the co-production of technology, (imperial) politics, and geography.\n\nIn the opinion of contemporary observers and actors, the opening of the Baghdad-Damascus motor route was a ‘conquest of the desert’, whose success they attributed to the rationality and commercial ability of the ‘pioneers’ of motor transport as well as to modern technology. This narrative overlooks the many ways in which desert topography played a part in the development of transdesert transport services in the 1920s. In contrast, I argue that the topographical features of the Syrian Desert (re)shaped the various components of the infrastructural system as well as the interests of the French and British Mandate powers in the region\n\nFirst, the paper seeks to demonstrate that the desert surface affected the transport infrastructure: the type of vehicle, the route, the type of traffic carried by road operators, and the material structure. In doing so, the paper does not seek to give in to the narrative that the desert ‘resisted’ its ‘conquest’ by the automobile, but to show how the various actors adapted to the topographical constraints, accommodated them, and even developed new forms of automobility. Second, the paper examines the ways in which the topography of the region played a role in the Franco-British relationship in the Eastern Mediterranean. As a trans-imperial or trans-Mandate route, the Baghdad-Damascus motor route offers a privileged site for examining cases of cooperation and rivalry between them.","author":[{"family":"Jaquier","given":"César"}],"citation-key":"Jaquier2020DesertTracksHighways","event-place":"Online","event-title":"MESA Annual Meeting","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,7]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"From Desert Tracks to Highways of Empires?

  {"id":"Johnston2015HomegrownWorldCat","abstract":"OCLC’s WorldCat Metadata API now allows libraries to set and delete their OCLC holdings without using Connexion or Batch Services. St. Olaf College Libraries had used up our “one free turn” at a reclamation several years ago. Unfortunately due to the normal inconsistencies that accumulate over time, as well as problems with holdings being set for us by external entities, we had reached a point where we were once again in need of reconciling our holdings with OCLC’s. This time we wanted to accomplish the reclamation in a low-cost way that would also allow us to have more local control over the process. Using the WorldCat Search API and Metadata API in tandem, we first retrieved all OCLC numbers with holdings currently set and deleted these holdings with a fairly simple Perl script. We then pulled from our local catalog all the OCLC numbers for which we wanted holdings set and updated again using the Metadata API. The result, in the words of one of our catalogers, is that “For the first time since I got here, 15 years ago, I feel our holdings finally reflect what we really own.” In this article, I will discuss the issues to consider if you wish to do a similar project with your OCLC holdings, share the Perl scripts I wrote for processing, and reflect on the pros and cons of the process overall.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnston","given":"Sarah"}],"citation-key":"Johnston2015HomegrownWorldCat","container-title":"The Code4Lib Journal","ISSN":"1940-5758","issue":"27","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,21]]},"source":"Code4Lib Journal","title":"Homegrown WorldCat Reclamation: Utilizing OCLC’s WorldCat Metadata API to Reconcile Your Library’s Holdings","title-short":"Homegrown WorldCat Reclamation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/10328"},

  {"id":"Joseph2018","abstract":"Family remains the most powerful social idiom and one of the most powerful social structures throughout the Arab world. To engender love of nation among its citizens, national movements portray the nation as a family. To motivate loyalty, political leaders frame themselves as fathers, mothers, brothers, or sisters to their clients, parties, or the citizenry. To stimulate production, economic actors evoke the sense of duty and mutual commitment of family obligation. To sanctifytheir edicts, clerics wrap religion in the moralities of family and family in the moralities of religion. Social and political movements, from the most secular to the most religious, pull on the tender strings of family love to recruit and bind their members to each other. To call someone family is to offer them almost the highest possible intimacy, loyalty, rights, reciprocities, and dignity.  In recognizing the significance of the concept of family, this state-of-the-art literature review captures the major theories, methods, and case studies carried out on Arab families over the past century. The book offers a country-by-country critical assessment of the available scholarship on Arab families. Sixteen chapters focus on specific countries or groups of countries; seven chapters offer examinations of the literature on key topical issues. Joseph's volume provides an indispensable resource to researchers and students, and advances Arab family studies as a critical independent field of scholarship.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,18]]},"archive":"JSTOR","citation-key":"Joseph2018","collection-editor":[{"family":"Joseph","given":"Suad"}],"DOI":"10.2307/j.ctt1pk860c","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"publisher":"Syracuse University Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"Arab Family Studies: Critical Reviews","title-short":"Arab Family Studies","type":"book","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1pk860c"},

It looks at the history of policy battles over access to education in the post–World War II era and at the narrower versions that have played out in relation to research and textbooks, from library policies to book subsidies to, more recently, the several “open” publication models that have emerged in the higher education sector.From the bottom up, Shadow Libraries explores how, simply, students get the materials they need.

Aside from being one of the three women's journals that started publication in the aftermath of the Young Turk Revolution, the importance of Kadın is connected to the fact that it was the only Ottoman women's journal published at the centre of the revolution. A close reading of Kadın reveals the complexities of debates on women's issues that took place at the time, and as such challenges some of the common assumptions regarding the subject in the field.

It is credited with pumping fresh life into studying the Humanities at a time when the relevance of Humanities is being questioned. However, the role of the ‘digital’ in studying the Humanities – whether DH is an autonomous field, or merely a data-driven technique/application, or characterises new methodologies that equip us to probe into new ‘objects of inquiries – is often debated. In this article, we revisit the debates, contentions and contingencies around DH, with the intent to stir up conversations on the concerns about and faultlines of what may be referred to as an ‘Indian framework’ of DH practice. We examine the constituency of DH in India and the epistemic implications of the attempts towards its formalisation, which must be understood as a knowledge project linked to the prevailing episteme. In brief, we examine the ‘epistemic rupture’ that marks the emergence of DH in India.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kar","given":"Sunanda"},{"family":"Ray","given":"Avishek"}],"citation-key":"KarRay2023ConstituencyDigital","container-title":"South Asian Popular Culture","DOI":"10.1080/14746689.2023.2271275","ISSN":"1474-6689","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,2]]},"page":"273-278","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The constituency of Digital Humanities in India","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14746689.2023.2271275","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"Kasm2018RedefiningPublicsMosireen","abstract":"The article traces the rise of Mosireen, a non-profit media collective, within the parameters of revolutionary and post-revolutionary Egypt's public sphere. It highlights how the Mosireen Collective strategically co-opted the infrastructure of the internet during critical periods of the Egyptian revolution as a tool of resistance to fight injustice, expose human rights violations and restore some semblance of accountability. Moreover, it explores Mosireen's innovative online/offline digital activism which enabled formerly marginalized publics to access new modes of information and challenge elite-driven discourses, thereby contributing to the “democratization” of the public sphere. The article further investigates Mosireen's emancipatory use of technology where the creation of an oppositional framework not only sustained “resistance from below” movements but also seemed to open up new potentialities for counter-hegemonic spaces and alternative discursive frameworks of society. The article provides a rich case study in how ideological struggles and questions of power are interpreted within the broader realm of Egyptian civil society with a particular focus on the power of visual production and its effect on the development of digital counter-publics. Finally, the limitations of the public sphere under neo-liberal capitalism are contextualized and critiqued within the context of the Mosireen Collective and broader digital resistance movements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,18]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Kasm","given":"Saeb"}],"citation-key":"Kasm2018RedefiningPublicsMosireen","container-title":"State Crime Journal","DOI":"10/gg4969","ISSN":"2046-6056","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"100-140","publisher":"Pluto Journals","source":"JSTOR","title":"Redefining Publics: Mosireen, State Crime and the Rise of a Digital Public Sphere","title-short":"Redefining Publics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.13169/statecrime.7.1.0100","volume":"7"},

Disrupting the Digital Humanities seeks to rethink how we map disciplinary terrain by directly confronting the gatekeeping impulse of many other so-called field-defining collections. What is most beautiful about the work of the Digital Humanities is exactly the fact that it can't be tidily anthologized. In fact, the desire to neatly define the Digital Humanities (to filter the DH-y from the DH) is a way of excluding the radically diverse work that actually constitutes the field. This collection, then, works to push and prod at the edges of the Digital Humanities -- to open the Digital Humanities rather than close it down. Ultimately, it's exactly the fringes, the outliers, that make the Digital Humanities both heterogeneous and rigorous. This collection does not constitute yet another reservoir for the new Digital Humanities canon. Rather, its aim is less about assembling content as it is about creating new conversations. Building a truly communal space for the digital humanities requires that we all approach that space with a commitment to: 1) creating open and non-hierarchical dialogues; 2) championing non-traditional work that might not otherwise be recognized through conventional scholarly channels; 3) amplifying marginalized voices; 4) advocating for students and learners; and 5) sharing generously and openly to support the work of our peers.\"--Back cover","citation-key":"KimStommel2018DisruptingDigital","editor":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Dorothy"},{"family":"Stommel","given":"Jesse"}],"event-place":"Goleta","ISBN":"978-1-947447-71-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY-NC-SA 4.0","note":"OCLC: 1065523749","number-of-pages":"509","publisher":"Punctum Books","publisher-place":"Goleta","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Disrupting the digital humanities","type":"book","URL":"https://muse.jhu.edu/book/66813"},
  {"id":"Kirmizialtin.Wrisley+2020+AutomatedTranscriptionNonLatin","abstract":"Our study utilizes deep learning methods for the automated transcription of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century periodicals written in Arabic script Ottoman Turkish (OT) using the Transkribus platform. We discuss the historical situation of OT text collections and how they were excluded for the most part from the late twentieth century corpora digitization that took place in many Latin script languages. This exclusion has two basic reasons: the technical challenges of OCR for Arabic script languages, and the rapid abandonment of that very script in the Turkish historical context. In the specific case of OT, opening periodical collections to digital tools require training HTR models to generate transcriptions in the Latin writing system of contemporary readers of Turkish, and not, as some may expect, in right-to-left Arabic script text. In the paper we discuss the challenges of training such models where one-to-one correspondence between the writing systems do not exist, and we report results based on our HTR experiments with two OT periodicals from the early twentieth century. Finally, we reflect on potential domain bias of HTR models in historical languages exhibiting spatio-temporal variance as well as the significance of working between writing systems for language communities that have experienced language reform and script change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Kirmizialtin","given":"Suphan"},{"family":"Wrisley","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"Kirmizialtin.Wrisley+2020+AutomatedTranscriptionNonLatin","container-title":"arXiv:2011.01139 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,2]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Automated Transcription of Non-Latin Script Periodicals: A Case Study in the Ottoman Turkish Print Archive","title-short":"Automated Transcription of Non-Latin Script Periodicals","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01139"},
  {"id":"Klein2020DimensionsScale","abstract":"This essay calls for a conceptual reorientation of how quantitative methods in literary studies are currently framed, arguing for an expansion from a linear model bounded by the endpoints of distant and close to a space defined by multiple dimensions of scale. I explore the axis bounded by visible and invisible as an example of one of the additional dimensions that might constitute this expanded conceptual frame. In demonstrating its potential for producing new knowledge, I examine the editorial work of two women abolitionists, Mary Ann Shadd (1823–93) and Lydia Maria Child (1802–80). I show how topic modeling and statistical analysis can help identify and describe their invisible editorial labor. I thus provide an additional layer of evidence in support of the argument that positions women, and black women in particular, at abolition's vanguard. I also show how both women employed editing as a method of community formation and world building. I conclude by extending the example of editorial work to the labor required to perform quantitative work today, underscoring the importance of expanding the frame in which quantitative methods in literary study are conceptualized and deployed.

  {"id":"KoksalNacar2020MarketingMeatLate","abstract":"This paper examines animal trade from provinces, mainly the Anatolian ones, to Istanbul from the mid-19th to the early 20th century. This was a period in which the Ottoman state moved away from provisionism to liberal economic policies. Animal trade and meat supply of Istanbul was influenced by this change with the abolition of ondal?k a?nam (a special tax levied for the purpose of ensuring a cheap supply of meat for the residents of Istanbul) and loosening of control over meat prices in 1857. However, there are very few studies that examine how Istanbul was supplied with meat after the mid-19th century. This paper seeks to address this gap in the literature by analyzing gradual adoption of liberal economic policies and continuation of provisionist concerns at different levels of state administration.\n\nBefore the mid-19th century, maintaining a steady supply of animals and keeping meat prices low for both the palace and residents of Istanbul was the priority of the state. The paper will initially discuss some provisioninst policies pursued by the Ottoman government in the 1840s and 1850s. This include the imposition of price ceilings, promulgation of punitive orders to redirect sheep flocks to Istanbul, and efforts at eliminating intermediaries between producers and consumers in times of need. Then, we will analyze how the elimination of such policies in the late 1850s changed the market dynamics and actors involved in meat trade by drawing on a variety of primary resources including Ottoman and British archival documents, newspapers, and traveler accounts. Following the elimination of price ceilings, some merchants sought to exercise control over animal supply and thereby to manipulate the meat prices in the imperial capital. In discussing how such activities were responded by the Istanbulites and state offices, the paper shows that different state institutions responded differently to the abolition of provisionist policies. For instance, while the municipality of Istanbul pushed for price control especially at times of war and famines, the Ministry of Trade and Council of State consistently followed a laissez-fair approach.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper argues that establishment of a free market economy in meat trade did not show a linear development in Ottoman Istanbul. Instead, that was a slow and conflictual process involving various social actors such as herders, meat traders, butchers, residents of Istanbul, and state officials. The findings suggest that we need to problematize development of liberal economy based on concrete case studies.","author":[{"family":"Koksal","given":"Yonca"},{"family":"Nacar","given":"Can"}],"citation-key":"KoksalNacar2020MarketingMeatLate","event-place":"Online","event-title":"MESA Annual Meeting","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,5]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"Marketing Meat in Late Ottoman Istanbul: Feeding People and Profiting Merchants","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"KresseSounaye2022Thinking","abstract":"# publisher's abstract\n\nAs far too many intellectual histories and theoretical contributions from the ‘global South’ remain under-explored, this volume works towards redressing such imbalance. Experienced authors, from the regions concerned, along different disciplinary lines, and with a focus on different historical timeframes, sketch out their perspectives of envisaged transformations. This includes specific case studies and reflexive accounts from African, South Asian, and Middle Eastern contexts. Taking a critical stance on the ongoing dominance of Eurocentrism in academia, the authors present their contributions in relation to current decolonial challenges. Hereby, they consider intellectual, practical and structural aspects and dimensions, to mark and build their respective positions. From their particular vantage points of (trans)disciplinary and transregional engagement, they sketch out potential pathways for addressing the unfinished business of conceptual decolonization. The specific individual positionalities of the contributors, which are shaped by location and regional perspective as much as in disciplinary, biographical, linguistic, religious, and other terms, are hereby kept in view. Drawing on their significant experiences and insights gained in both the global north and global south, the contributors offer original and innovative models of engagement and theorizing frames that seek to restore and critically engage with intellectual practices from particular regions and transregional contexts in Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East.

It argues for a blurring of the work of archivist and historian in reconstituting the archive of the liberation struggle. It alters the paradigmatic frameworks of the Cold War that have hitherto defined the structure of the archive. The article provisionally anticipates the trajectories of a politics of digitisation, while complicating our notion of information by tracking its emergence in colonialism and the restrictive paradigms of the Cold War. Calling for a constitution of the archive that undercuts both colonial precedents and Cold War paradigms, it argues for a politics of digitisation that will expand what can be said about the history of liberation struggles in Southern Africa by redefining the meaning of the postcolonial.

  {"id":"LisanAlHal:1884","abstract":"It is no secret that the true purpose of the widening and construction of roads (ṭuruq) is not only the decoration and beautification of the face of the city (balada) as some say, but the true purpose are improvements of health and the economy. health: too narrow streets gather bad smells and illness that effect the health of the inhabitants (sukkān). in the narrow quarters (maḥalla) neither sunlight nor clean air can enter. economy: narrow and crooked streets (ṭuruq) are packed with people (al-nās), passers-by and those in transit, causing a jam of people all being delayed in their business. all this is aggravated by the beasts of burden, caravans of camels etc. the widening and construction of streets also causes the moral improvement and pleasure of the townspeople (sukkān) Therefore inhabitants of the illustrious cities (al-mudun al-fayḥāʾ) take care of the roads, their maintenance, repair, widening, and construction. We just saw roads measuring 60 pics in width and more, with buildings lining them in perfect symmetry, all beautifully paved and with paved sidewalks on both sides. tramway lines run in the middle of the street. to the right and left drive coaches, beasts of burdens are driven, and walk carriers. pedestrians are save on the sidewalks. and trees provide shadow to those resting from fatigue. but in ancient cities (al-mudun al-ʿaẓīma) the streets (ṭarāʾiq) are narrow and paved with cobblestones and no sidewalks. we heard about projects to pave the road with black stones but the cobblestones still deteriorate from the hooves of horses, coaches, beats of burden, and the feet of the people (al-nās) for many years and nothing happened. unfortunately such pavement is available only in the cold countries and those of mild climates without the brute heat of the summer. we believe that this is valid for Damascus without the coast of syria, [grammar doesn’t make sense at this point], namely to pave the roads with - squared / quartered cobble (al-bulāṭ al-murabbaʿ): first the road is covered in sand, on which the cobblestones are laid. the gaps between them are again filled with sand. lying head to toe on the road. - pavement with rectangular cobble: which lays head to side on the street, “which is difficult to describe in written form”. a road thus paved would be most enduring and beautiful and a most modern street. and it is said that these are the best streets (ṭarāʾiq) currently possible. - this road will be lined with trees and paved sidewalks on both sides. ... description of the various tools used: the best and fastest is a a carriage (‘araba) with unusual wheels, which is drawn by one or two horses. it drags a large cylinder of 3 pics (dhirāʿ/ adhraʿ) length and a surface of 1 pic or more. it is hollow and its surface is covered with a fabric. this carriage sweeps and streets and produces a flat and even surface. Our sublime state (dawlatunā) provides for the reconstruction of its towns (bilādahā) through sufficient laws: the law on provincial municipalities (qānūn baladiyyat al-wilāyāt), the law of expropriation of real-estate for public benefit (niẓām istimlāk al-imlāk li-ajli al-manāfiʿ al-ʿumūmiyya) and the law on new buildings (niẓām al-abniyya al-jadīda). the elections for the municipal administrations have taken place [here], they commenced works. revenues have been generated and a large part of it has been assigned to repairs. in only a few years when the financial situation approves does our face for complains and articles remain with us? is the income available for us ? is the labour commissioned to us? according to our opinion (ḥisbinā), the income of the municipality in Damascus amounts to more than £T 8.000 p.a.. If the municipality assigned half of this amount to [street] cleaning, street lights, and wages of the officials, some £T 4.000 would remain for paving roads with a width of 20 pic and a length of 2.000 pic, i.e. 20.000 [sic!] square pics on the assumption that the square feet costs 1 mecidiye. BUT during last election some members had been elected to the baladiya, who are not inhabitants of the quarters they are responsible for (laysa baʿḍihim bi-ahli lahā), and the right / legally ascribed amount was not assigned to the repairs (interest = maṣlaḥa). the income was sometimes spent on areas not under their jurisdiction and sometimes on works in some neighbourhoods (ḥārāt) conducted in the old manner, which is damaging and not benefiting. street cleaning has been neglected to the extend that the filth cannot be removed anymore … and there are many more such examples. many years have passed since the formation of a municipality and its subsequent division. now there are four bodies and until now it is possible to say that all of them together and the old municipality did nothing but broadening Sūq al-Buzūriyya and Sūq Jaqmaq on the expense of the their owners, building the two banks of the River Barada with the stones (aḥjār or iḥjār?) of the citadel … we do not belong to those saying that we have to destroy our city (balada) and broaden its streets, straighten its curves, and pave it in one or two years for it to look like Paris or London within a very short period, or if we say that we have to walk on the path of reforms … or that we have to begin to work to rebuild everything. but if we limit our work to grafting and repairs (i.e. Flickschusterei) it will be to no avail and we will continue with grafting the old pavement, working today and (re)commencing tomorrow calling on the heads and the members of the four municipalities to focus on their legal duties and the task bestowed upon them as to lighting and cleaning etc., raising six numbered demands 1) broadening of streets (ṭuruq) to the width established by Art 1 of the new building code. procedures and prices for necessary expropriations are established in the respective law. 2) straightening of roads through this and that (bi-taqdīm hadhā wa taʾkhīr dhalika) following the example 3) paving these roads and their sidewalks according to the manners provided above 4) planting to lines of beautiful trees on its sides to protect passers-by / pedestrians from the heat of the sun. protect it from livestock with wooden boxes made for it [what does this mean?] 5) provide paved sidewalks for every street and separate human traffic (mimar al-nās) from beasts-of-burden. people will walk on the sidewalk, animals and coaches on the the middle of the road 6) coordinate the (design of the) buildings lining the sides of the road, i.e. provide a uniform design. this should resemble, according to the opinion of the people, modern buildings of course, this cannot be achieved quickly, or within one or two years, and not with insufficient funds. completion will be further eased by scaling the work to the capacity of the municipality and the endurance of the people (taḥammul al-ahālīn). to engage this project, the author suggests the following measures to be adopted by the four municipalities 1) each municipality should draw up a map of all streets (ṭuruq), alleys (jādāt), alleyways (aziqqa), and suqs under its jurisdiction, including its width, necessary width according to the building code. this will show the necessary work for the future. without such a map, the members cannot possibly know what they should do. the project shall be implemented by the provincial engineer 2) exert its competence over all new buildings to be erected in accordance with the map. thus, the streets will be gradually broadened with the reconstruction of neighbouring buildings 3) show the people (irāʾat al-ahlīn) the drawing of buildings in order for them to be of one design etc. the lining buildings should be like a single building in the construction of windows, doors, height etc. this shall be exclusively limited to the buildings lining the public alleys (al-jādāt al-ʿumūmiyya) . 4) each municipality to assign half of its revenue to street lightening, cleaning, and wages and the rest to the repairs. if this is insufficient, taxes should be levied in its quarters 5) streets shall not be paved before they are widened and straightened, because this would waste funds. 6) the implementation of these measures should not be delayed by any considerations, but the practical labour within the current capability of the municipalities and the endurance of the people should begin (tabtadī bi-ʿamal faʿlan). thus each municipality will complete one alley of the most important alleys every year. ¡pb n=\"4\"/¿ again recounting the steps as laid out in this memorandum and the laws: one alley and street after the other, every year 7) repairs should be made using clean hewn stones on public alleys (jādāt ʿumūmiyya) instead of the adobe found in villages which is unsuitable for an illustrious city (bi-madīna ghināʾ). there should be no doubt among the inhabitants about this measure, thus the municipality should issue decisions to the end that hitherto everybody who wants to erect a wall alongside a public alley inside the city (balada), has to do so in clean and hewn stone, in their annual general meeting 8) mud-plaster is equally banned.

  {"id":"LisanAlHal:1888","abstract":"heavy and outspoken critique of public works and the municipality: all the plans are flawed. properties are destroyed and the new projects are costly without any benefit - the municipality had been set up some 15 years ago and inflicted heavy expenses on the people (al-ahālīn) in general. - money has been wasted and the people (ahālīn) suffer from the enormous expenses and still walk through a town that has not changed a bit. we ask how all the commissions through all these years have not managed to do anything? - yet most of the projects, such as the large roads jammed with pedestrians like the Mīdān road are still narrow contrary to Art 4 of the building code until passing them becomes a fight and lethal battle: camels, caravans, donkeys carrying wood, thousands of people, arrivals from the villages, sellers and buyers of grain. - sometimes the ground of the pavement / sidewalk (raṣīf) is only 3 pics, such as in front of the Ḥammām al-Nāsirī, and 2,5 pics are sold with only half a pic remaining for the pedestrians. - similarly the newly cut roads with thousands of crooks due to bad plans that cut through houses. a lot of money is spend on it and then, when it missed the middle of a house, they cut through it once again, and even a third time all in one month. this is due to corrupt planning and flawed engineering (i.e. the cut opposite the dār al-jundī) - sometimes the shops of poor proprietors are hit and cut through. and once the shop is reopened, it takes only two months for another cut to be executed … (i.e. at the dukān al-Ḥuṣrī in the Sūq al-Aghnām). - sometimes a road is planned and constructed and buildings are erected alongside. then, when half it is completed, the plans are changed and everything is pulled down again. (this happened, for instance, with the Lūqānṭa ʿAlī Bey and all the magazines around it and the Makhāzin al-Maʿārif etc.) - sometimes a long and broad Sūq is opened on which the municipality and the people (al-ahālī) spent thousands of £T on the cutting of the new long Sūq until the people hope that it will be one of the most beautiful suqs of Damascus connecting its east with its west from Bāb al-Sharqī to the Darwīshiyya. this took a long time and then all the buildings were constructed according to the old pattern [i.e. not following the new laws] - sometimes the people spent thousands and thousands on the construction of the Sūq like Sūq al-Ḥamīdiyya but due to flawed planning and the profit of a single man, the Sūq is inclined and skewed so that no one seeing it can recover from bemoaning it. - sometimes an important Sūq shall be established, such as Sūq al-Jābiyya and the shops of the leather-makers … - these are examples of the works of our municipality … it should employ engineers who did not learn their trade at the school of its sole engineer and they shall be tasked with drawing the general map (kharīṭa muntaẓama ʿumūmiyya) of the city in which all its Suqs, roads (ṭuruq), streets (shawāriʿ), alleyways, squares, public gardens (ḥadāʾiq al-ʿāmma), all its benefits/ assets are designated with the necessary width, they shall plan the new streets. etc. etc. the municipality should enter houses through their doors and not through their back -walls.","citation-key":"LisanAlHal:1888","container-title":"Lisān al-Ḥāl","event-place":"Bayrūt","issue":"1079","issued":{"date-parts":[["1888",7,19]]},"language":"ar","page":"3-4","publisher-place":"Bayrūt","title":"Murāsilāt: al-Shām fī — al-jārī","type":"article-newspaper"},

  {"id":"Mahony2018Cultural","abstract":"Digital humanities has grown and changed over the years; we have moved away from expecting technology to be a tool to make humanities research easier and faster into one where we are now equal partners. Our collaborative projects drive forward the research agendas of both humanists and technologists. There have been other changes too. The focus of our scholarly interest has moved away from its historical origins in text-based scholarship, although that now has many more possibilities, and we are seeing an interest in exploring culture and heritage more widely. Where the progress is slower is in our moves towards openness and inclusivity, and this is to some extent hampered by a lack of linguistic diversity. This is being addressed with specialist groups within the major DH organizations on a national and a global level. DH has grown rapidly in China, and the anglophone world could do more to engage with practitioners and potential colleagues in this new vibrant and emerging area. There are certainly Western centres that specialize, particularly in Chinese texts and historical documents, but this needs to be extended further if we are not to impose limits on the conversations, synergies and collaborations that can result.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,2]]},"archive":"https://web.archive.org/web/20230302230206/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40647-018-0216-0","author":[{"family":"Mahony","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"Mahony2018Cultural","container-title":"Fudan Journal of the Humanities and Social Sciences","container-title-short":"Fudan J.

  {"id":"Mazza2020DealForgetCemal","abstract":"In 1915 Cemal Pasha made on offer to Albert Antebi to sell the area in front of the Western Wall in Jerusalem in order to dismantle the nearly 30 houses owned by Moroccans and create a space ‘reserved for the prayers of the Jewish people.’ Since the mid-nineteenth century wealthy European Jews tried to purchase the same area from the Ottomans but to no avail. The reasons for a denial were different but things did not change under the British despite the support given to the Jews with the Balfour Declaration. After the incidents occurred in 1929 any possibility to acquire the Western Wall was postponed. This paper will briefly address the correspondence available at the Zionist Archives showing the individuals involved took an oath not to ever discuss this business, and highlighting the divisions among Zionists in relation to holy places and symbols. Narratives produced in the following years and decades neglected this event as Zionism became the dominant ideology dictating the writing of the history of the emerging state of Israel after 1948. A perusal of traditional Zionist narratives shows that this event fell victim of the erasure of Ottoman Palestine. Works discussing the history of Zionism and the history Palestine during the war has revealed a static narrative where the four years of military dictatorship of Cemal Pasha have come to epitomize four centuries of – anti-Jewish, later anti-Zionist and anti-Arab - Ottoman rule. Zionist narratives have been built with the purpose to provide meaning for Jewish self-determination and settlement in Palestine. In other words they understood Zionism as a movement that set out just to do that – Jewish self-determination – and in that viewing Zionism in a secular and nationalist light, they simply have not attributed importance to a seemingly isolated episode, such as the purchase of the Western Wall, that may have complicated things, suggesting Zionism has also a quasi-messianic component not in line with Zionist orthodoxy. In the end the Western Wall affair and its failure did not look good: first its purchase may have not fit the paradigm of redemption (the conquest of 1967 did so much better) and secondly its failure was not worth to be reported while the basis for the creation of the state of Israel were being laid down and the Wall was adopted, this time, as a national symbol.","author":[{"family":"Mazza","given":"Roberto"}],"citation-key":"Mazza2020DealForgetCemal","event-place":"Online","event-title":"MESA Annual Meeting","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,16]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"A Deal to Forget: Cemal Pasha and the sale of the Western Wall","type":"paper-conference"},

This volume takes its starting point in the non-Arabic and non-Muslim communities, tracing their linguistic and literary practices as part of a number of interlinked processes, including that of religious modernization, of new types of communal identity politics and of socio-political engagement with the emerging nation states and their accompanying nationalisms. These twentieth-century developments are firmly rooted in literary and linguistic practices of the Ottoman period, but take new turns under influence of colonization and decolonization, showing the versatility and resilience as much as the vulnerability of these linguistic and religious minorities in the region.

It is found across different cultures, writing systems, and languages. Yet whilst the concept of equalising the width of lines in a column to achieve a rectangular block is shared, the techniques that are employed towards this end are diverse. This paper discusses the justification of Arabic text. It lays out the methods that evolved in manuscript practice and reflects on their interpretation in typography. It casts a spotlight on the origins of the typographic justification techniques in Europe and compares them in three case studies to examples from the nineteenth century Middle East. A sketch contextualises how Arabic justification changed under the influence of technology and prepares the ground for a review of the provisions found in current typographic environments. The paper then presents the state-of-the-art of digital text layout for Arabic and queries its suitability.

It provides a systematic description of the various statistical tests used in Corpus Linguistics which can be used in translation research. In Part 1, Theoretical Explorations, the interplay between quantitative and qualitative methodologies is explored. Part 2, Essential Corpus Studies, describes how to undertake quantitative studies, with a suitable level of technical and relevant case studies. Part 3, Quantitative Explorations of Literary Translations, looks at translations of classic works by Cao Xueqin, James Joyce and other authors. Finally, Part 4 on Translation Lexis uses a variety of techniques new to translation studies, including multivariate analysis and game theory.

Divided into three sections, it first surveys matters regarding the digital archive in general, examining the impact of the media on the institutional and cultural significance of archives, their scope and accessibility, the complexities of their preservation and, crucially, the scholarship produced in and around them. The second section explores how digital archives of both digitized materials and borndigital ones have intersected with the origin and consolidation of the Digital Humanities in the US, underscoring the way these intersections have fostered the development of suitable methodologies and vocabularies to examine digitized and born-digital cultural products. The third section explores a handful of Mexican projects developed in the last few years, and proposes that Mexican digital literary scholarship is unique in its emphasis on decolonial perspectives, community building and recovery, education and training, and new creative expressions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Ortega","given":"Élika"}],"citation-key":"Ortega2018Archives","container-title":"Hispanic Review","DOI":"10.1353/hir.2018.0016","ISSN":"0018-2176","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"229-247","publisher":"University of Pennsylvania Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"Archives, Libraries, Collections, and Databases: A First Look at Digital Literary Studies in Mexico","title-short":"Archives, Libraries, Collections, and Databases","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/90020971","volume":"86"},

She is generally quoted as the founder of the periodical <em>Fatāt al-šarq</em> (Eastern Young Woman, 1906), and subsequently of the first Arab periodical in Latin America (<em>Šarq wa-Ġarb</em>, East and West) during her four-year experience in Chile. Her juvenile novel <em>Qalb al-raǧul</em> (Man’s Heart), published in 1904, is set during and after the social events that shook Lebanon in 1860. The story initially is based on the traditional <em>topos</em> of a contrasted, romantic love and then evolves into an original narrative, characterised by the acute observation of social reality. I highlight here how Hāšim’s narrative embodies a formal and substantial shifting from a romantic and pastoral narrative to a more realistic model. In particular, issues as love, friendship and the quest for self-realisation are vividly discussed throughout the novel, through dialogic and realistic scenes from the daily life of the merchant class.</p></section>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Paniconi","given":"Maria Elena"}],"citation-key":"Paniconi2019WomenFictionalWriting","container-title":"Oriente Moderno","DOI":"10/gg8fw6","ISSN":"2213-8617, 0030-5472","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,17]]},"language":"en","page":"136-156","publisher":"Brill","section":"Oriente Moderno","source":"brill.com","title":"Women’s Fictional Writing and Social Morality: a Reading of Qalb al-raǧul (Man’s Heart, 1904) by Labībah Hāšim","title-short":"Women’s Fictional Writing and Social Morality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/ormo/99/1-2/article-p136_8.xml","volume":"99"},
  {"id":"PasekEtAl2023World","abstract":"The climate impacts of the information and communications technology sector?and Big Data especially?is a topic of growing public and industry concern, though attempts to quantify its carbon footprint have produced contradictory results. Some studies argue that information and communications technology's global carbon footprint is set to rise dramatically in the coming years, requiring urgent regulation and sectoral degrowth. Others argue that information and communications technology's growth is largely decoupled from its carbon emissions, and so provides valuable climate solutions and a model for other industries. This article assesses these debates, arguing that, due to data frictions and incommensurate study designs, the question is likely to remain irresolvable at the global scale. We present six methodological factors that drive this impasse: fraught access to industry data, bottom-up vs. top-down assessments, system boundaries, geographic averaging, functional units, and energy efficiencies. In response, we propose an alternative approach that reframes the question in spatial and situated terms: A relational footprinting that demarcates particular relationships between elements?geographic, technical, and social?within broader information and communications technology infrastructures. Illustrating this model with one of the global Internet's most overlooked components?subsea telecommunication cables?we propose that information and communications technology futures would be best charted not only in terms of quantified total energy use, but in specifying the geographical and technical parts of the network that are the least carbon-intensive, and which can therefore provide opportunities for both carbon reductions and a renewed infrastructural politics. In parallel to the politics of (de)growth, we must also consider different network forms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Pasek","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Vaughan","given":"Hunter"},{"family":"Starosielski","given":"Nicole"}],"citation-key":"PasekEtAl2023World","container-title":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/20539517231158994","ISSN":"2053-9517","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"20539517231158994","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The world wide web of carbon: Toward a relational footprinting of information and communications technology's climate impacts","title-short":"The world wide web of carbon","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"Podeh2013CelebratingContinuityRole","abstract":"National holidays are one of the major instruments of regimes and rulers aiming to legitimise their hegemony and maintain the social and political order. This article deals with the way in which successive Syrian regimes have celebrated the national—secular and religious—holidays. It compares the various Syrian regimes: the monarchy (1918–1920); the mandate period (1920–1946); and the republic period (1946–present).Although the latter period will be treated as a whole, the analysis differentiates between five periods: post-independence (1946–1958); the United Arab Republic (UAR; 1958–1961); the secessionist regime (1961–1963); and the Ba‘th regime (1963–present), with Bashar replacing his father in June 2000. The main thesis of this article is that Syrian regimes prefer continuity over change in the realm of state holidays. Thus, in contrast to Iraq, where each new regime has attempted to delegitimise its predecessor by abolishing the national calendar and inventing a new one, Syrian regimes have added new holidays to the calendar without erasing the old ones. In this way, Syria's calendar resembles an edifice occasionally renovated according to the regime's needs, but never demolished. This policy emanated from a desire to demonstrate continuity even in times of change and upheaval, while at the same time consolidating the local national identity, which has often competed with other supra-identities, such as pan-Arabism and Islam.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Podeh","given":"Elie"}],"citation-key":"Podeh2013CelebratingContinuityRole","container-title":"British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies","DOI":"10/gg8fx5","ISSN":"1353-0194","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",10,1]]},"page":"428-456","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Celebrating Continuity: The Role of State Holidays in Syria (1918–2010)","title-short":"Celebrating Continuity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13530194.2013.811633","volume":"40"},

  {"id":"Putnam2016Transnational","abstract":"This essay explores the consequences for historians’ research of the twinned transnational and digitized turns. The accelerating digitization of primary and secondary sources and the rise of full-text web-based search to access information within them has transformed historians’ research practice, radically diminishing the role of place-specific prior expertise as a prerequisite to discovery. Indeed, we can now find information without knowing where to look. This has incited remarkably little reflection among mainstream historians, but the consequences are profound. What has become newly possible? How do the new digital affordances relate to the current boom in transnational topics and approaches? How do the reach, speed, and granularity of digitized search impact our ability to reconstruct the supranational past? This essay heralds the novel forms of knowledge-generation made possible by technological transformations. It also attempts an accounting of all the ancillary learning that international research in an analog world once required. What kinds of knowledge and insight did place-based research across borders instill? What are the intellectual and political consequences of leaving that behind?","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Putnam","given":"Lara"}],"citation-key":"Putnam2016Transnational","container-title":"The American Historical Review","container-title-short":"The American Historical Review","DOI":"10/gcvjtg","ISSN":"0002-8762","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",4,1]]},"page":"377-402","source":"Silverchair","title":"The Transnational and the Text-Searchable: Digitized Sources and the Shadows They Cast","title-short":"The Transnational and the Text-Searchable","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ahr/121.2.377","volume":"121"},
  {"id":"Radio2020Applyingminimalcomputing","abstract":"The infrastructures undergirding linked data projects are complex and varied. As the technological stacks and social infrastructures come into greater maturity, the general landscape has grown in complexity too, possibly to the point of being overwhelming for GLAM institutions. As a result it can be difficult to separate out what tools are essential for linked data initiatives from what are not. Similarly, complexity has increased in these projects possibly to the point of obfuscating their practical ends. The framework of minimal computing provides a useful lens for interpreting the role of technologies with an aim towards identifying needless complexity and increasing access through concretely asking what is actually needed for a successful project. Further, it seeks to tie these efforts to their social impacts and how it can build capacity for those working in non-Western societies. By exploring specifically the concepts of minimal design, dependencies, and maintenance and others, we may be able to more effectively examine those aspects of linked data that could be reconfigured or disbanded. Hopefully, this would lead towards an environment that purposefully addresses the challenges that arose in previous decades of GLAM metadata without introducing newer forms of complexity As so many decisions cascade from how the real world is defined in ontologies, minimal computing has much to offer towards simplifying the infrastructures and conditions that they necessarily outline. This session applies principles of minimal computing to ontology design using the example of a glacier ontology in development at the University of Colorado Boulder. Specifically we will address how using minimal computing is in line with a more materialist approach to data modeling that seeks to aim linked data initiatives within concrete realities and away from unwarranted abstraction. Practical advice for how to apply minimal computing principles to other areas of linked data projects will also be addressed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Radio","given":"Erik"}],"citation-key":"Radio2020Applyingminimalcomputing","event-place":"Online","event-title":"2020 LD4 Conference on Linked Data in Libraries","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,20]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"Applying minimal computing to ontology design","type":"speech","URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzjUfwNQmTg"},

The chapter will focus on the development of the digital divide, explaining how it is not the simple access to the Internet itself (first level of digital divide) that determines digital inequalities, but rather the motivations, skills, and purpose of use (second level of digital divide) that influence online inequalities. The chapter goes beyond the binary approach of ‘have’ and ‘have not’, by introducing and discussing the third level of digital divide, seen as the social and cultural benefits deriving from accessing and using the Internet, stressing how social and digital inequalities are intertwined. The third level of digital divide focuses on the social consequences of Internet usage and it moves away the focus from the digital arena, by addressing it as a social issue.\n\n# critique\n\n- doesn't mention knowledge of languages, and particularly knowledge of English, as impeding access","author":[{"family":"Ragnedda","given":"Massimo"}],"citation-key":"Ragnedda+2019","container-title":"Mapping the digital divide in Africa: A mediated analysis","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctvh4zj72.6","editor":[{"family":"Mutsvairo","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Ragnedda","given":"Massimo"}],"event-place":"Amsterdam","ISBN":"9789462986855","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","note":"BibTeX Key: Ragnedda+2019\noclc: 1090685704\nuuid: 02744793-A893-4FEC-A2DA-8C2AAB36508E","page":"27-44","publisher":"Amsterdam University Press","publisher-place":"Amsterdam","source":"WorldCat","title":"Conceptualising the digital divide","type":"chapter"},

The Digital Black Atlantic spans the African diaspora's range--from Africa to North America, Europe, and the Caribbean--while its essayists span academic fields--from history and literary studies to musicology, game studies, and library and information studies. This transnational and interdisciplinary breadth is complemented by essays that focus on specific sites and digital humanities projects throughout the Black Atlantic. Covering key debates, The Digital Black Atlantic asks theoretical and practical questions about the ways that researchers and teachers of the African diaspora negotiate digital methods to explore a broad range of cultural forms including social media, open access libraries, digital music production, and video games. The volume further highlights contributions of African diaspora studies to digital humanities, such as politics and representation, power and authorship, the ephemerality of memory, and the vestiges of colonialist ideologies.

  {"id":"Schmidt2020PrivilegeSelect","abstract":"A large part of the literature published in the ‘Global South’ is barely covered by bibliographic databases. Institutional policies increasingly require researchers globally to publish in ‘international’ journals, draining local infrastructures. The standard-setting power of ‘Global South’ scholars is minimised further. My main aim is to render visible the ways in which European academic libraries contribute to this situation. It is explained as a consequence of specific features of current world society, referred to as coloniality, social injustice, and quantified communication. The thesis analyses peripherality conceptually and scientometrically: based on a sample, how is Southeast African basic social sciences and humanities (SSH) research integrated in global scholarly communication, and how do local dissemination infrastructures develop under these conditions? Finally, how are professional values, specifically neutrality, and workflows of European academic libraries, interrelated with these developments? The methodological approach of the thesis is multi-faceted, including conceptual analyses, scientometrics, and a short survey of collection managers and an analysis of the corresponding libraries' collection policies. The off-mainstream decolonial scientometric approach required the construction of a database from multiple sources. Southeast Africa was selected as a field for some of the empirical studies included, because out of all rarely studied local communities to which a peripheral status is commonly attributed, the large majority of Southeast African authors use English as their primary academic language. This excludes linguistic reasons for the peripheral attribution. The theoretical and conceptual point of departure is to analyse scholarly communication as a self-referential social system with global reach (Luhmann). In this thesis, an unorthodox understanding of social systems theory is developed, providing it with cultural humility, inspired by decolonial thinking. The value of the approach lies in its in-built capacity for social change: peripheries are constructed communicatively, and culturally humble communication avoids adding to the accumulation of peripheral references attributed to the ‘Global South’, for instance by suspending the incarceration of area studies which tends to subsume any research from and about Africa as African studies, remote from the core of SSH. While centrality serves the necessary purpose of reducing the overwhelming complexity of global research, communicative centres can just as well be constructed as topical, and do not require a spatial attachment to be functional. Another advantage of this approach is its awareness of different levels of observation, differentiating, for instance, between whether the academic librarian's neutrality is imagined as playing out in interaction with the user (passive neutrality), as representing the diversity of the research system (active neutrality), or as balancing social bias running through society at large, and hence furthering social justice (culturally humble neutrality).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Nora"}],"citation-key":"Schmidt2020PrivilegeSelect","DOI":"10.5281/zenodo.4011296","event-place":"Lund, Sweden","genre":"PhD Thesis","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,2]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Lund University, Faculties of Humanities and Theology, Lund Studies in Arts and Cultural Sciences","publisher-place":"Lund, Sweden","source":"Zenodo","title":"The Privilege to Select.

  {"id":"Schmidt2023OpenAccess","abstract":"To meet the information needs of subject experts, so-called open-access subject repositories have been established since the early 1990s, which make relevant documents available as a collection. These repositories are still exclusively operated in the “Global North”. Can they meet the global diversity of requirements? How can these platforms be managed with cultural humility? A planned open-access knowledge sharing platform for the field of international cultural relations is the occasion for this study. The production of knowledge in this field takes place globally in institutions of different type: academic, educational, political and economic. The communities of practise produce classic publishers’ publications, but also so-called “grey literature” which often is hard to discover and preserve. The report is based on desk research, supplemented by a three-months open commenting period, and a public workshop whose participants dispose over substantive experience with the analysed technologies and practises, or are members of the communities of practise, amongst them experts who work in “Global South” contexts. In result, a recommendation matrix was developed which tackles the most important issues: balancing “Global North” privileges by subtraction instead of just adding diversity, working towards social justice by involving the communities of practise from the very start, setting up a polycentric governance structure based on values defined by the communities, establishing ethics of care and translation processes to mediate different roles and to accommodate individual needs, supporting multilingualism, low connectivity environments, interoperability and experiments, all with a critical stance towards standardisation and rationalisation, planning for the long term sustainably, collaborating and cooperating, doing everything transparently, at a moderate pace, learning humbly and perpetually.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Nora"}],"citation-key":"Schmidt2023OpenAccess","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,4]]},"language":"eng","source":"Zenodo","title":"Open-Access Repositories Decolonial.

  {"id":"SchwartzEtAl2021ModelingBornDigital","abstract":"Although the TEI has traditionally been used for encoding text, its combination of structured and semi-structured data has made it a compelling choice for born-digital, linked-data resources as well. Our intent here is to demonstrate the advantages it offers for digital prosopographies along with a model that can be used for them. Syriac Persons, Events, and Relations (SPEAR) is a born digital prosopography project in the field of Syriac studies. Where traditional prosopographies focused on prose descriptions of individual persons of significance, SPEAR follows recent developments in research methodologies that instead produce prosopographical factoids. Factoids are structured data about persons drawn from the analysis of historical texts. Most factoid prosopographies use relational databases to model data. Instead, SPEAR uses a customized TEI schema to model factoids that can be queried and visualized in an XML database as well as serialized in HTML for human viewers and in RDF for data sharing. The TEI’s provisions for structured and semi-structured data make it ideal for encoding data from heterogeneous historical source material. Moreover, its linking capabilities connect SPEAR data to related data sets. By modeling prosopographical factoids, and not the source texts themselves, SPEAR offers an example of how a born-digital, data-oriented approach to using the TEI can circumvent some of the challenges posed by the tree structure of XML. It also disrupts traditional understandings of data and stand-off markup through combining Linked Open Data approaches with the use of the TEI.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Daniel L."},{"family":"Gibson","given":"Nathan P."},{"family":"Torabi","given":"Katayoun"}],"citation-key":"SchwartzEtAl2021ModelingBornDigital","container-title":"Preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,12]]},"language":"en_US","license":"Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International","source":"oaktrust.library.tamu.edu","title":"Modeling a Born-Digital Factoid Prosopography using the TEI and Linked Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/handle/1969.1/192423"},

  {"id":"Siles2023Living","abstract":"A nuanced account from a user perspective of what it's like to live in a datafied world. We live in a media-saturated society that increasingly transforms our experiences, relations, and identities into data others can analyze and monetize. Algorithms are key to this process, surveilling our most mundane practices, and to many, their control over our lives seems absolute. In Living with Algorithms, Ignacio Siles critically challenges this view by surveying user dynamics in the global south across three algorithmic platforms--Netflix, Spotify, and TikTok--and finds, surprisingly, a more balanced relationship. Drawing on a wealth of empirical evidence that privileges the user over the corporate, Siles examines the personal relationships that have formed between users and algorithms as Latin Americans have integrated these systems into the structures of everyday life, enacted them ritually, participated in public with and through them, and thwarted them. Sometimes users follow algorithms, Siles finds, and sometimes users resist them. At times, users do both. Agency lies in the navigation of the spaces in-between. By analyzing what we do with algorithms rather than what algorithms do to us, Living with Algorithms clarifies the debate over the future of datafication and whether we have a say in its development. Concentrating on an understudied region of the global south, the book provides a new perspective on the commonalities and differences among users within a global ecology of technologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Siles","given":"Ignacio"}],"citation-key":"Siles2023Living","event-place":"Boston","ISBN":"978-0-262-54542-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,25]]},"language":"en","publisher":"MIT Press","publisher-place":"Boston","title":"Living with Algorithms: Agency and User Culture in Costa Rica","title-short":"Living with Algorithms","type":"book"},

These discussions are situated within wider work on language technologies, language documentation and international (in particular European) language-based infrastructure creation. Drawing on both primary and secondary research, this four-part book features 13 diverse case studies of infrastructural projects, pedagogical resources, computational models, interface building, and publishing initiatives in a range of languages, including Arabic, French, Russian, Portuguese, Italian, German, Spanish, Bengali, Hindi, Malayalam, and Tamil.

  {"id":"TapperTapper1987BirthProphetRitual","abstract":"The anthropology of Islam has for too long been dominated by dichotomies such as 'orthodox'/ 'popular', and by a presumption that Muslim women are subordinate in religious as in other matters. The religious activities of men cannot be explained solely in terms of their degree of 'orthodoxy', and those of women should not be dismissed a priori as peripheral to those of men. These propositions are supported by an analysis of men's and women's mevlud recitals in a Turkish town. In Turkey, where the state has limited men's public religious activities, the central religious mystery of salvation is celebrated particularly in the women's mevluds through a particular construction of the life of the Prophet Muhammad. it is argued that an intrinsic relation between gender and religious orthodoxy is characteristic of practised Islam everywhere, and that the elucidation of this relation must be central to anly anthropology of Islam. Such a perspective may also stimulate investigations of the relation between Islam and other religious systems. Here we suggest various transformational relations, for example between the treatment of Muhammad in the mevlud and certain Christian constructions of Jesus.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Tapper","given":"Nancy"},{"family":"Tapper","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"TapperTapper1987BirthProphetRitual","container-title":"Man","container-title-short":"Man","DOI":"10.2307/2802964","ISSN":"0025-1496","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1987"]]},"page":"69-92","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Birth of the Prophet: Ritual and Gender in Turkish Islam","title-short":"The Birth of the Prophet","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2802964","volume":"22"},

SCRIBE/KÂTİB has been constantly evolving since its initial development in 2016, as The Baki Project transcribers and other users identify issues and suggest improvements for the tool. The core feature of SCRIBE/KÂTİB is that every transcription decision (i.e. every character typed) is captured together with metadata about the character. The metadata contains information about the character including, but not limited to: the Turkish transcription alphabet symbol, the Ottoman script extended Arabic alphabet symbol, the symbol’s order of importance and any need for disambiguation (for distinguishing this character from other visually similar characters). This paper will discuss tool development to date, showcase manuscript transcription output, and present future iterations of SCRIBE/KÂTİB, which focus on building out collaborative features, such as authentication, a project management system, and integration of other digitized texts with The Baki Project’s manuscript database through communication with other right-to-left transcription tools.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Taşkın","given":"Gülşah"},{"family":"Ketchley","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Kuru","given":"Selim"},{"family":"Dietzler","given":"Natasha"},{"family":"Holland","given":"Brad"},{"family":"Patel","given":"Rutvi"}],"citation-key":"Taskin.etal+2021+SCRIBEKATIBA","event-place":"Online","event-title":"DHSI 2021: Right to Left","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,8]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"SCRIBE/KÂTİB: A Tool for Digitizing Arabic Alphabet-Based Ottoman Turkish Texts","type":"speech","URL":"https://dhsi.org/dhsi-2021-online-edition/dhsi-2021-online-edition-aligned-conferences-and-events/dhsi-2021-right-to-left/full-access/"},
  {"id":"Taylor2020Ottomanpropertyrights","abstract":"This paper will argue that scholars have misunderstood the emergence of property right—specifically, property right in regard to land and real estate—in the Ottoman Empire because we expect it to follow a model familiar from Western historiography. That is, we expect that property rights start with a politically elite class and trickle down to other groups. In the Ottoman Empire, however, property right was not characterized by an initial grant of security from monarch to the elites, but as a grant of security from the monarch to the peasants: instead of property right trickling down, it trickled up. In the sixteenth and seventeenth century, the right of tasarruf (peasant usufruct on the treasury lands known as miri land) became increasingly legally defined and protected from intervention by the state, its agents or other parties. It was characterized by a lifetime tenure and limited right of inheritance that favored vertical descendants. With the approval of an authority figure, it could be transacted with the payment of a large upfront fee and smaller yearly payments thereafter. By the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century, these features served as a model of a specifically Ottoman property right that had spread to other social groups: artisans received this same property right ‘bundle’ in the form of gedik, urban renters in the form of icareteyn, and a‘yan in the form of the malikane. These features were the basis of the property right extended to all Ottoman subjects in the 1858 Land Code—which continued to refer to this right as tasarruf.\n\nBased on kanunnames, fatwas and texts of jurisprudence in Ottoman Turkish and Arabic produced between 1540 and 1858, the paper offers significant revisions to the current understanding of the history of property right in the Ottoman Empire. First, it puts the dissemination of the indigenous concept of tasarruf at the heart of the narrative rather than attempting to trace the origin of private property. Secondly, it draws attention to the central role of peasant cultivators in the evolution of property right and ultimately of political right, directly challenging the assumption that peasants are not a class with enough clout to make much of an impact politically. Finally, the paper cautions historians from normalizing specifically European narratives of state development and private property that privilege the role of a landed aristocracy.","author":[{"family":"Taylor","given":"Malissa"}],"citation-key":"Taylor2020Ottomanpropertyrights","event-place":"Online","event-title":"MESA Annual Meeting","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,17]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"Ottoman property rights over the longue durée: a history of \"Trickle Up\"","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"TEIP5Guidelines400","abstract":"TEI P5 version 4.0.0 Release 4.0.0 is codenamed ‘Galileo’ in honor of Galileo's arrival to Rome on 13 February 1633 to face the Inquisition. We associate Galileo with decentering the earth in official western dogma of the universe. Similarly, the stand-off model in this release of the TEI Guidelines may serve to decenter our models of digital texts and expand our frames of reference. With the addition of standOff, a significant change in how characters outside of Unicode are described, and the ability of TEI to self-nest, this version is significantly different than previous versions, and thus deserves an increase in the “major” release number. In addition to the stand-off model, this release introduces new features and resolves a number of issues raised by the TEI community. As always, the majority of these changes and corrections are a consequence of feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI community using the GitHub tracking system. A full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the 4.0.0 milestone. The following changes are particularly worth highlighting in this release:  The standOff element functions as a container element for linked data, contextual information, and stand-off annotations embedded in a TEI document (#374, thanks to Laurent Romary and Piotr Bański). With the introduction of the standOff element a new structural class model.describedResource has been introduced, and model.resourceLike has been revised and renamed model.resource. As the TEI element is a member of the new model.describedResource class, it can now be a child of another TEI element. The new standOff element:  is a child of TEI (or teiCorpus); may contain stand-off annotations, for example morphosyntactic annotations encoded with spanGrp or annotationBlock; may contain stand-off markup, for example a series of certainty, linkGrp, or alt elements; may contain contextual information, for example listPerson and listPlace; may contain information that must be pointed to from elsewhere, but is not found in the source document, for example a castList that represents characters who speak in a drama, but whose roles are not listed in the source document's printed cast list. New elements, attributes, and an attribute class have been introduced for using Unihan properties in TEI (#1805, thanks to Duncan Paterson):  The attribute class att.gaijiProp provides attributes for defining the properties of non-standard characters or glyphs.  The name attribute provides the name of the character or glyph property being defined. The value attribute provides the value of the character or glyph property being defined. The version attribute specifies the version number of the Unicode Standard in which this property name is defined. A list of suggested values is provided. The localProp element provides a locally defined character (or glyph) property. The unicodeProp element provides a Unicode property for a character (or glyph). The unihanProp element holds the name and value of a normative or informative Unihan character (or glyph) property as part of its attributes. A list of legal values from the Unicode Han Database is provided for the name attribute on unihanProp. The use of the elements charProp, charName, localName, unicodeName, and value has been deprecated. Changes were made to improve the precision of language in the Guidelines referring to conformance (#1588) Multiple Schematron rules, assertions, or reports in a single constraintSpec are now correctly output as a single sch:pattern in the RELAX NG schemas (#1625). The discussion of validation has been updated in A Gentle Introduction to XML (#1708). The attributes mode and ident have been added to the remarks element (#1713). The elements decoNote, explicit, and incipit are now members of the model.biblPart class (#1784). The description of the points attribute in att.coordinated has been clarified (#1789). The xr element is now a member of the attribute class att.typed (#1810). Our use of the Travis continuous integration server has been migrated from travis.org to travis.com (#1826). An example to specify the source of a translation has been added (#1830). The description of manuscript descriptions clarifies that msDesc can be used for all text-bearing objects (#1835). The content model of repository, institution, and collection has been changed from macro.xtext to macro.phraseSeq.limited (#1836). The g element is now available within the zone element (#1838). The placeName element has been added to the class model.settingPart and the example in the setting element has been changed accordingly (#1842). The dateline element is now a member of the class model.pLike.front (#1843). The catDesc element is now a member of the attribute class att.canonical (#1864). A Schematron rule has been added to only allow one remarks element per language in specification files (#1872). The datatype of the name attribute of the attRef element has been changed from teidata.text to teidata.name (#1878). The schema has been tightened to prevent a combination of valList in sequence with other members of model.contentPart (#1862). With the addition of the subtype attribute to the attribute class att.textCritical, subtype is now available on lem, rdg, and rdgGrp (#1867). The content model of teiCorpus has been changed (#1922). The constraints for teidata.word have been loosened to allow any character except Unicode separators or control characters (#1930). The explanation of Relax NG and XPath, together with its associated graphic in the chapter A Gentle Introduction to XML have been revised (#1949). Corrections of typographic errors and broken links, improvements on explanations, and corrections of examples have been conducted in various sections of the Guidelines (including #1760, #1847, #1887, #1907, #1909, #1927, #1936, #1948, #1952, #1954, #1964, #1965, #1968, #1969). Furthermore, a number of translations have been added or updated. In addition, many improvements have been made to the XSLT stylesheets (which provide processing of TEI ODD files for Roma and OxGarage as well as other TEI conversions). The Stylesheets are maintained separately from the Guidelines at https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets. A full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the 7.49.0 milestone. Highlights of this release include:  The type attribute on biblScope has been replaced by the unit attribute in the tests (#213). Orphaned files in the test directory have been removed (#216). Relative paths to CSS files in the EPUB transformation have been replaced with absolute paths (#312). The jquery library has been updated (#359). Special characters encoded as <w:sym> in DOCX are now converted to hi elements (#389). Correct handling of Schematron rules in attDef elements (#403 and #1950). Finally, we have made some significant updates to our documentation and the website:  Documentation of Council practices in TCW 20 is improved for working with branches in the TEIC GitHub repository #1825. The documentation for updating the TEI Framework in oXygen to the latest release of the TEI Guidelines has been improved #1673 and added to the oxygen-tei repository, see How to automatically update your TEI framework in oXygen. Corrections have been conducted in various sections of the TEI website (including #1944), and #1938.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,7]]},"author":[{"literal":"TEI Consortium"}],"citation-key":"TEIP5Guidelines400","DOI":"10.5281/zenodo.3413524","genre":"XML","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,13]]},"publisher":"Zenodo","source":"Zenodo","title":"TEI P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange","title-short":"TEI P5","type":"software","URL":"https://zenodo.org/record/3667251","version":"4.0.0"},

Transkribus, an EU-funded software package that is designed to train machine-learning based HTR models, has seen great success for multiple, primarily European, languages, However, Transkribus has certain difficulties when it comes to training models using RTL languages, which they are trying to address based on user feedback. This talk will reflect on the processes of model training for eighteenth century Ottoman Turkish (OT) paleography, using Transkribus, with a particular focus on RTL support after the reverse text integration update of March 16, 2021. Due to the fact that OT was written in Arabic script and modern historical transcription conventions use latinized transcription alphabets, researchers needed to either reverse their text or mirror their images before uploading them to Transkribus to train a model that follows academic transcription guidelines. This created additional challenges and barriers in model training, such as taking extra steps to reverse the transcribed texts before uploading that this update aims to amend. By comparing the experiences of data uploading and processing before and after this update, this talk offers insights into how RTL languages can be successfully supported in digital resources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Teşküler","given":"Merve"}],"citation-key":"Teskuler+2021+OttomanTranskribusTraining","event-place":"Online","event-title":"DHSI 2021: Right to Left","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,8]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"Ottoman Transkribus: Training HTR+ Models for Eighteenth-Century Ottoman Turkish Paleography","type":"speech","URL":"https://dhsi.org/dhsi-2021-online-edition/dhsi-2021-online-edition-aligned-conferences-and-events/dhsi-2021-right-to-left/full-access/"},

  {"id":"Thompson+1971","abstract":"theory:instead of spasmodic simplicism, which argues that riots are a direct and spontaneous expression of hunger (put forward by Rostow, p.77), Thompson bestowes the peasantry with agency and a tactic to achieve well defined political aims by the means of riots that are set in a \"moral economy\", and inter alia triggered by hunger (78): \"The food riot in eighteenth-century England was a highly-complex form of direct popular action, disciplined and with clear objectives.\" Food riots worked as means to uphold the threat of social unrest, which caused the authorities to adopt measures for ensuring the supply with affordable corn, although many actual food riots did not achieve their goal of lower bread prices.The town-country conflictuality is mediated through bread prices (79). And although men did not live from by bread alone, many lived largely on bread (c.f. Grehan 2007) (80), i.e. in times of high prices more than 50 % of the disposable income was spent on bread (82). He is then going into details of the bread market, how prices were deliberated, how the darker bread was always suspected to be adulterated, how the chain of supply worked etc. In the perfect \"moral economy\", along the \"paternalist model\" ( until c.1770s), a direct marketing from the producers to the consumers is supervised by market inspectors during official market hours only (83), c.f. the muḥtasib. Millers and bakers worked for an allowance and not profit in the smaller towns where such an idealistic model could be observed. (83) In London the baker worked for a profit officially allotted to him (84).- \"the crowd derived its sense of legitimation, in fact, from the paternalist model.\" [ of a just and good ruler]. (95) All throughout the 18th century complaints and petitions against the selling by sample and prices set through market mechanisms rather than the paternalist \"just\" price (85-6). In later 18th century the authorities again and again claimed that hoarding is against the common and established law. In times of scarcity some measures were adopted to prosecute alleged hoarding. This had little effect in lowering prices but provided legitimacy for the authorities (88).Such measures were criticized by adherents of a liberal and free market policy (i.e. Adam Smith in 1773), depicting an ideal picture of a perfect market situation (89-90). [However, grain supply is not based on the demand but relies on harvest times and] the demand is highly inelastic to soaring prices. On the contrary, in times of soaring prices, the poor might eat more corn, since they cannot afford any other foodstuffs anymore (91).a strong and almost superstitious belief in adulteration among the population, who resorted to lynch justice against suspected millers and bakers (with the quietist support of the ruling authorities that sought to channel the discontent towards other scapegoats) and calls for local economies; i.e. exporting grain is seen as one of the vices to be rioted against (97-8, and follwwing pages). threats to destroy infrastructure such as ships, ports and canals (100). SInce the poor worked in the lowest levels of the grain trade, they had rather concise information on the amounts transported (115)role of women: in many occasions women were the initiators of riots (115-6).In many an occasion the protestors could force the ones protested against into a bargain with the threat of looting (117). However, commonly the demand was for fair prices and not for supplies free of charge (117).Riots did not require a high level of organization but a communal consensus to protect the protestors from retaliation (119). But how successful were such riots? The effect on the prices does not follow a generalised pattern: sometimes prices fell, sometimes they rose, and sometimes nothing changed at all. So, did the threat of riots function as a check for bread prices? (120) Thompson: the anticipation of riot must have figured as a means to put relief measures into action (123). Such anticiption couldn't have worked without actual riots being staged, despite being not too overtly successful (125-6).in 19th century the \"old tradition\" of bread riots  came to an end and a \"new tradition\" of labour struggle of united Englishmen employed in wage labour emerged (128)final conclusion:\"The breakthrough of the new political economy of the free market was also the breakdown of the old moral economy of provision. After the wars all that was left of it was charity and Speenhamland. The moral economy of the crowd took longer to die: it is picked up by the early co-operative flour mills, by some Owenite socialists, and it lingered on for years somewhere in the bowels of the Cooperative Wholesale Society. One symptom of its final demise is that we have been able to accept for so long an abbreviated and \"economistic\" picture of the food riot, as a direct, spasmodic, irrational response to hunger-a picture which is itself a product of a political economy which diminished human reciprocities to the wages-nexus.\" (136)","author":[{"family":"Thompson","given":"Edward Palmer"}],"citation-key":"Thompson+1971","container-title":"Past and Present","DOI":"10.2307/650244","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1971"]]},"language":"en","note":"uuid: 049BC3BE-F993-4D45-A4BA-223C0B50898E","number":"1","page":"76-136","publisher":"Oxford University Press on behalf of The Past and Present Society","title":"The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century","title-short":"Moral Economy","type":"article-journal","volume":"50"},

Michael Provence, Mesut Uyar, and James Gelvin recount broader phenomena of this era, yet contemporary individual accounts are limited. Laila Parsons addresses this period, but with sources published later. Benjamin Fortna examines this period, but focused on Anatolia after the war, while Salim Tamari, Glenda Abramson, and the Lone Pine (Bloody Ridge) Diary concentrate on the war. With its early sections long overlooked or mischaracterized, Ottoman army officer Taha al-H?shim?’s Arabic-language, journal-like memoirs, the Mudhakkirat Taha al-H?shim?, written at the time of the events recorded, provide a first-hand account of this post-war period. My research, combining social, military, and intellectual history, centers on the 1919-1920s sections of this work, which recounts his navigation of post-war Yemen, Damascus, Istanbul, and Baghdad.\nThrough al-H?shim?’s periodic, sometimes daily entries, it is possible to glimpse a contemporary perspective of a larger group of Ottoman officers from Arab lands who remained in service immediately following the war. His entries demonstrate pervasive fears of British and French colonialism and imperialism, evident in comparisons of anticipated post-war Ottoman territories to contemporary colonies across North Africa, East Africa, and South Asia. His entries also demonstrate manifestations of both Ottoman and Arab identification, reflecting the power of continuity, his long military training, and the multiplicity of identification that defies later historical projections. Finally, al-H?shim?’s observations reveal a multitude of nationalist activist organizations in Damascus during Faysal’s brief reign and on the eve of French occupation. These arguments and analyses engage with several key works in particular, especially Michael Provence’s The Last Ottoman Generation and the Making of the Modern Middle East, James Gelvin’s Divided Loyalties: Nationalism and Mass Politics in Syria at the Close of\nEmpire, and Benjamin Fortna’s Imperial Classroom: Islam, the State, and Education in the Late Ottoman Empire. This analysis reveals a contemporary account and glimpses of the lived experience from a perspective long marginalized by later Turkish or Arab Revolt nationalist narratives. It offers examples of anticolonial Ottoman Arab officer subjectivities, continuity, and manifestations of multilayered identification, as well as an individual’s attempt to re-legitimate the self after the experiences of war and imperial occupation and fragmentation.","author":[{"family":"Tomlinson","given":"Sean"}],"citation-key":"Tomlinson2020OttomanArabArmy","event-place":"Online","event-title":"MESA Annual Meeting","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,16]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"An Ottoman Arab Army Officer at the End of World War I","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"Verlato2020LongLivethis","abstract":"My paper examines the writings of Egyptian writer, journalist, and poet ‘Abdallah Nadim “Al-Nadim” (1842-1896) on the relation between language, history, and education. I focus on a series of articles that Nadim published in his journal Al-Ustadh in 1892 and 1893, which offer a periodization of the history of Egypt based on the diffusion, shifts in prominence, and disappearance of various languages, beginning with the advent of Arabic, through the Mamluk and Ottoman rule, until the diffusion of European languages and the British occupation. My paper’s analysis is threefold. Firstly, I examine how Nadim’s linguistic periodization shaped his conceptions of the nature and role of the Arabic language, particularly in the realm of education, and its relation to other languages in Egypt overtime. I situate the author’s analysis with respect to, on the one hand, the traditional corpus of Arabic scholarship on linguistic studies and, on the other hand, the emergence of modern linguistics in the nineteenth century and novel conceptions of linguistic exchange and translation during the Nahda. I argue that Nadim’s privileging of the linguistic metaphor to comment on his country’s past and current culture and society should be read as symptomatic of a broader tendency to put language and theories of linguistic exchange at the center of intellectual and political discussions during this period.\n\nSecondly, I focus on Nadim’s style, particularly his use of a comically disproportionate number of loan words in Arabic. In line with the author’s distinctive satirical and playful writing mode, such programmatic linguistic hybridity within the monolingual space of the Arabic text, I propose, works to reaffirm stylistically his historical argument. Finally, I turn to Nadim’s propositions regarding the future development of culture and politics in Egypt, chiefly through education. Just as his interpretation of the past was “language-centric,” so was his vision of the future. In particular, I connect Nadim’s lifelong commitment to reforming education across Egypt and engagement in nationalist politics to his call, in these articles, for the need of promoting monolingual instruction at a time of widespread pushes for foreign language education in schools across Egypt. Ultimately, my paper seeks to shed light on the historical relation between language and history in the nineteenth and early twentieth century generally, and in Nadim’s works specifically, maintaining that his vision of Egypt’s linguistic future should be understood as a comprehensive project of political and cultural reform.","author":[{"family":"Verlato","given":"Olga"}],"citation-key":"Verlato2020LongLivethis","event-place":"Online","event-title":"MESA Annual Meeting","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,17]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"\"Long Live this Language:\" History, Language, and Education in the Writings of ‘Abdallah Nadim","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"Wall2016HarlemRenaissancevery","abstract":"\"The Harlem Renaissance was a cultural awakening among African Americans between the two world wars. It was the cultural phase of the \"New Negro\" movement, a social and political phenomenon that promoted a proud racial identity, economic independence, and progressive politics. In this Very Short Introduction, Cheryl A. Wall captures the Harlem Renaissance's zeitgeist by identifying issues and strategies that engaged writers, musicians, and visual artists alike. She introduces key figures such as Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Claude McKay, and Jean Toomer, along with such signature texts as \"Mother to Son,\" \"Harlem Shadows,\" and Cane. In examining the \"New Negro,\" she looks at the art of photographer James Van der Zee and painters Archibald Motley and Laura Wheeler and the way Marita Bonner, Jessie Fauset, and Nella Larsen explored the dilemmas of gender identity for New Negro women. Focusing on Harlem as a cultural capital, Wall covers theater in New York, where black musicals were produced on Broadway almost every year during the 1920s. She also depicts Harlem nightlife with its rent parties and clubs catering to working class blacks, wealthy whites, and gays of both races, and the movement of Renaissance artists to Paris. From Hughes's \"The Negro Speaks of Rivers\" to W.E.B. Du Bois's novel Dark Princess, black Americans explored their relationship to Africa. Many black American intellectuals met African intellectuals in Paris, where they made common cause against European colonialism and race prejudice. Folklore - spirituals, stories, sermons, and dance - was considered raw material that the New Negro artist could alchemize into art. Consequently, they applauded the performance of spirituals on the concert stage by artists like Roland Hayes and Paul Robeson. The Harlem Renaissance left an indelible mark not only on African American visual and performing arts, but, as Cheryl Wall shows, its legacies are all around us\"--","author":[{"family":"Wall","given":"Cheryl A."}],"call-number":"PS153.N5 W327 2016","citation-key":"Wall2016HarlemRenaissancevery","collection-title":"Very short introductions","event-place":"New York, NY","ISBN":"978-0-19-933555-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"135","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"New York, NY","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The Harlem Renaissance: a very short introduction","title-short":"The Harlem Renaissance","type":"book"},
  {"id":"Wallach2020Hebrewcolonialityearly","abstract":"Throughout most of the nineteenth century, Hebrew was hard to come by in the streets of Jerusalem. Yet in the early twentieth century, after significant Jewish immigration to the city, Hebrew was suddenly everywhere. Stone inscriptions on Jewish institutions, pilgrims’ graffiti, token coins in the market, Ottoman postcards in Hebrew, commercial placards, rabbinical notices, big signs on modern schools and hospitals, newspapers and more.\n\nAs I explore in my forthcoming book \"City in Fragments: Urban Text in Modern Jerusalem\" (Stanford University Press, 2020), this dramatic proliferation of Hebrew in the streets accommodated several competing, and contradictory political projects. The historiography provides a narrative of the Haskala followed by the movement of Hebrew Revival, the Tehiya, in which the language acquired distinct national, Zionist dimensions - against Ashkenazi Orthodox hostility. Yet the emphasis on the Hebrew’s revival as a national language obscures its no less important, and equally novel, colonial dimension. Hebrew became a language of territorialization, of claiming land, of rewriting and erasure. For Labour Zionists, Hebrew was a field to be colonised, as much as it was a tool of colonisation. The colonizing impetus of Hebrew is often discussed in the context of post-48 Israel, e.g. in the creation of the “Hebrew map”. In this talk I investigate the early moments of this transition in late Ottoman Jerusalem.\n\nIn this paper I consider the fractured and contested transformation of Hebrew into a language of colonization, focussing particularly on the role of language in urban space. I argue that the Zionification of Hebrew was a tool not only to colonise territory but also to colonise local Jewish communities. I explore local Jews’ ambivalent and sometimes hostile engagement with the project of Revival. I consider the diversity of modern Hebrew forms in late Ottoman Jerusalem, and the difference between non-colonial and colonial approaches. Finally, I ask what we could learn, from the urban texts of early twentieth century Jerusalem, about the possibilities of decolonising Hebrew.","author":[{"family":"Wallach","given":"Yair"}],"citation-key":"Wallach2020Hebrewcolonialityearly","event-place":"Online","event-title":"MESA Annual Meeting","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,16]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"Hebrew and coloniality in early twentieth century Jerusalem","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"Williams2020BloomingDesertsDisrupted","abstract":"In the nineteenth century, the Ottoman Empire contended with a myriad of challenges to its fiscal sovereignty and solvency, including encroachments on various financial assets, territorial losses, and unfavorable trade policies. To mitigate these challenges, the empire sought ways to carve out spheres of financial sovereignty and sources of revenue that would be independent of obligations to foreign powers while simultaneously mediating or preventing attempts by foreign concerns to intrude on Ottoman resources. The Sultan’s Privy Purse was one of the institutions that attempted to fulfill this objective. After suppressing the first Ottoman constitution in 1878, in 1879 Abdülhamid turned to substantially expanding the holdings of his Privy Purse, established initially in the 1850s to maintain the sultan’s properties. Often involving resources whose development required considerable capital outlay and a capacity to sustain losses, but promised substantial revenues if these efforts were successful, those who agreed to exploit these properties received special concessions, while substantial sums were lavished on making them productive using the latest technologies.\nIn Aleppo, one of the main resources incorporated into the Privy Purse were lands in the province’s east and southeast that lay in areas along the fluctuating boundary between cultivated and pasture lands. In the aftermath of territorial losses in the Balkans, it seems likely such resources were viewed as crucial to making up lost revenue. This paper focuses on the acquisition and administration of these lands. By examining the socioeconomic and ecological ramifications of these efforts to shore up imperial finances, the paper argues that in addition to expanding the Privy Purse’s resources, acquiring these lands provided a means for the state to appropriate a source of provincial elite capital accumulation, while transforming the desert borderlands with the assistance of rural communities. The paper also considers the repercussions of the reversion of these lands to state control after the CUP revolution. Lands with a similar status in Egypt, such as Khedive Isma‘il’s Daira Sanieh, have been extensively studied, but work on such properties in the empire’s European and Asian provinces are only now beginning to emerge. Using documents from the Privy Purse’s administration in the Ottoman archives, the paper examines the role of this property regime in Aleppo and its contribution to Ottoman efforts to carve out spheres of fiscal independence even as it also provided a mechanism to disrupt elite capital accumulation and intervene in rural communities and borderland environments.","author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Elizabeth"}],"citation-key":"Williams2020BloomingDesertsDisrupted","event-place":"Online","event-title":"MESA Annual Meeting","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,8]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"Blooming Deserts and Disrupted Provincial Capital Accumulation?

  {"id":"Winckler2019EmbarkingNewEra","abstract":"Biography is a genre with a long history in Arabic literature. This paper aims at demonstrating how Ǧurǧī Zaydān (1861–1914), one of the most prominent figures of the *Nahḍah*, adapted biographical writing to the needs of his time. The new medium of the periodical press seemed to be the most adequate means for him to realize his endeavors. The paper points to the central position accorded to biographical essays in *al-Hilāl*, the journal founded by Zaydān in 1892. Zaydān who saw himself in the role of the ‘educator of society’ pursued a twofold aim: the dissemination of historical knowledge and the presentation of role models. Through an exemplary reading of selected biographical essays published in the early years of *al-Hilāl*, the paper analyzes the style and structure of the essays and demonstrates how Zaydān selected and grouped the portrayed persons, building up a body of texts to be read as a series of exemplary lives. Focusing on the specifics related to the publishing medium, it examines various forms used by Zaydān to interact with the reader. Whereas, in previous research, much emphasis has been laid on the contents debated in the periodical press, I argue that it is particularly revealing to examine the effects and impact of form and style, of textual strategies and medial practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Winckler","given":"Barbara"}],"citation-key":"Winckler2019EmbarkingNewEra","container-title":"Oriente Moderno","DOI":"10/gg2rx7","ISSN":"2213-8617, 0030-5472","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,17]]},"language":"en","page":"68-93","publisher":"Brill","section":"Oriente Moderno","source":"brill.com","title":"Embarking upon a New Era through an Old Genre: Biographical Essays in Journals of the Nahḍah Period — Ǧurǧī Zaydān and al-Hilāl’s Early Years as Example","title-short":"Embarking upon a New Era","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/ormo/99/1-2/article-p68_5.xml","volume":"99"},

  {"id":"Wollina2018TracingIbnTulun","abstract":"Muḥammad Ibn Ṭūlūn is today fairly well known as a historian of Damascus. Yet, his numerous writings cover many more areas of contemporaneous knowledge production and some of those might have been more impactful for his reputation as a scholar. One area that has so far not received much attention is the scrutiny Ibn Ṭūlūn put into the organisation of knowledge within his library, his corpus, and even individual manuscripts. This article attempts one step at closing this lacuna by addressing the contents statements with which Ibn Ṭūlūn prefaced all his autograph manuscripts. It also proposes a methodology for utilising them as sources for manuscript history. Based on four primary case studies, the chapter uses a triad of extraction, recompilation, and reconstruction of manuscripts to assess the current state of multiple-text manuscripts vis-a-vis their original compilations. All four manuscripts ended up in the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin by the 1930s. The chapter makes use of a wide array of sources within and without these manuscripts to elucidate their historical trajectories from Ibn Ṭūlūn’s endowed library until their acquisition by Chester Beatty. Specific attention will be paid to their peregrinations in the 19th and early-20th centuries. In particular, early 20th-century photographic reproductions of those manuscripts can shed light on the most recent recompilations and reconstructions of these manuscripts. No survey on the emergence of contents statements in the Arabic manuscript tradition has yet been made. A focus on one author’s autograph corpus thus seems a more promising approach which generates verifiable results. Thus, it appears that Ibn Ṭūlūn’s contents statements were already standardised and would even be expanded by at least one (near-)contemporary.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Wollina","given":"Torsten"}],"citation-key":"Wollina2018TracingIbnTulun","container-title":"Journal of Islamic Manuscripts","container-title-short":"J.

Text alignment can be employed to achieve various purposes, such as collation, text reuse detection, and translation alignment (Yousef/Jänicke). We will present our work on two different alignment-related topics, detecting and visualizing textual reuse in Persian poetry and Translation alignment of Persian Poetry. The corpus we studied comes from the medieval period between the 10th and 14th centuries. It consists mainly of Shahnameh, Khayyam quatrains, Masnavi, and Divan Hafez. Persian literature is one of the richest and oldest literature in the world (Marashi), and Persian poetry has been translated into many languages. Most of the existing automatic alignment algorithms are unsupervised such as Giza++ and IBM Models (Brown et al); we aimed to benefit from the manually created translation pairs to align other poems. Our corpus contains a manually aligned English translation of Divan Hafez at word/phrase level, the alignment has been done by our colleagues Mariam Foradi and Saman Rezaie using Alphios (Almas/Beaulieu) and Ugarit (Yousef) alignment editors. This alignment has generated 24000 unique translation pairs, and we used these data to align Masnavi and Khayyam quatrains with their English translations.

  {"id":"Yucel2020HamidianPropertyRegime","abstract":"From the 1880s onwards, emlâk-i hümayûn became a legal category that designated the lands Sultan Abdülhamid II (r. 1876-1909) acquired as his personal private property under the Privy Purse. Although the concept of emlâk-i hümayûn predated enthronement of Sultan Abdülhamid II, Hamidian officials relied on this legal category to build an imperial policy across Ottoman domains and establish administrative institutions. This property regime associated with emlâk-i hümayûn sought to protect Ottoman sovereignty and to provide revenue for the Privy Purse -- among other reasons. While scholars of the Ottoman Empire produced extensive scholarship on the legal text of the 1858 Land Code and its implementation in the provinces, studies on the legal framework of Abdülhamid II’s property ownership or the administration of these properties remain very limited.\n\nThis paper will first explore the kinds of properties that the category of emlâk-i hümayûn encompassed by focusing on the revenues registered in the Privy Purse budgets in the Hamidian period. Thereby, I will shed light on the meaning of this legal category through which Abdülhamid II built a property regime. Second, I will demonstrate that Abdülhamid II not only sought to collect revenues from landed estates with agrarian production, but the Sultan, in his capacity as a private entrepreneur, also aimed to empower himself from mineral extraction, animal breeding, and even industrial production. Furthermore, no scholar to date fully explored the financial repercussions of this property regime. To shed light on this invisible income that Abdülhamid II accrued under the Privy Purse, this paper will present a study of budgets of the Privy Purse. I will discuss the revenues that Abdülhamid II accrued from emlâk-i hümayûn for financial years between 1880/1881 and 1905/1906, which are absent from state budgets.

We show how al-Mashʿalānī’s work consisted of a cultural process rather than a textual product or linguistic transfer. These translations introduced new social, political and epistemological concepts that were particularly important to societal changes in the Arab world – such as the notion of civil society, the relationship of the public to institutions of law and the police, the pursuit of justice, and ways of dealing with crime in the Western model of law and order – that al-Mashʿalānī deliberately adapted to the local Arab culture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Zachs","given":"Fruma"},{"family":"Bawardi","given":"Basilius"}],"citation-key":"ZachsBawardi2020Arab","container-title":"Die Welt des Islams","DOI":"10/gkscdj","ISSN":"1570-0607, 0043-2539","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,12]]},"language":"de","page":"79-101","publisher":"Brill","section":"Die Welt des Islams","source":"brill.com","title":"Arab Nation-building through Detective Stories in al-Ḍiyāʾ: The Cultural Translations of Nasīb al-Mashʿalānī","title-short":"Arab Nation-building through Detective Stories in al-Ḍiyāʾ","type":"article-journal","URL":"10.1163/15700607-00600A03","volume":"60"},

  {"id":"Zakar2020GeographicalKnowledgeCosmography","abstract":"Hundreds of geographical books and illustrations have been produced in Arabic and Ottoman-Turkish since the late 18th-century. With the proclamations of the Nizam-? Cedid and the Tanzimat, maps and documents titled “geography” (co?rafya), atlas (atlas), and later almanac (salname) proliferated with great speed amidst the emergence of the territorialized nation-state, intensifying militarization, and sweep capitalization of Middle Eastern economies. This body of spatial knowledge comprises both geography, information concerning life on earth usually portrayed as points, lines, and polygons, and cosmography, theories about the earth’s position in the universe represented as circles. Cosmography depicted phenomena through spheres from the celestial moving down to the planetary, the continental, the regional, and the urban. The aim of this presentation is to breathe life into the myriad of geographical works and objects produced in the modern period, outlining their historical value for understanding the challenges that the region confronted in the wake of military defeats, bankruptcy, and the proclamation of Ottoman reforms, and using it to identify the distinctive features of late imperial and post-Ottoman institutional, intellectual, and economic currents. From being rare and large artifacts accessible only within court circles and engineering schools, maps, atlases, and geographical books became more portable and popular as a form of representation and argumentation in military and infrastructure planning, financial policy, research, public education and advertising.This presentation examines how representations and metaphors of circles transformed throughout the proliferation of geographical language and tools in the 19th and the 20th-centuries. It brings together a new range of primary sources, from atlases and censorship decrees, scholarly works, and provincial almanacs, to financial, bureaucratic, and military records, to offer new insights on the transformation of cosmography and circular thinking throughout imperial reforms, capitalization, and militarization.","author":[{"family":"Zakar","given":"Adrien"}],"citation-key":"Zakar2020GeographicalKnowledgeCosmography","event-place":"Online","event-title":"MESA Annual Meeting","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,16]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"Geographical Knowledge, Cosmography and Reform in the Late Ottoman Empire","type":"paper-conference"},

The encoding used the platform Recogito, which allows for semantic encoding of names and places, in addition to visualisation options and downloading the annotations in various formats. The annotations were also uploaded to Google sheets to further analyse and visualise the results in a quantifiable manner. The data for this study includes two Arabic novels by two Egyptian female authors. The first is Rain Over Baghdad (2010) by Hala El Badry, the second is Brooklyn Heights (2011) by Miral al-Tahawy. Both authors tell the story of and by female narrators but in two very different worlds. One is set at the heart of the Arab world (between Baghdad and Cairo) and the other at the centre of America’s East coast, New York. The seemingly opposite worlds, one steeped in Arab heritage and the other clinging to memories of one, provide rich material to analyse and compare including names of people, their relationships, names of places, countries, cities, villages and alleyways. The number of times each name is mentioned, the type of relationship described, the form a name takes, all help to paint new strokes in the world of the narrative and highlight the author’s perspective in building the characters. The encoding of the names of people in both novels was marked by a variety of tags including gender (male/female), status (historical, celebrity), and sometimes country. The Arabic language imposed some challenges on the annotation process in Recogito (there is no NER for Arabic, semantic constraints for bulk annotations, etc); but the encoding process itself also revealed a lot about the name/place traditions in modern Arabic novels and their authors’ styles. The search discusses some of these issues such as first/last name and cultural issues (e.g. Nora vs Um Yasser), titles (ست | د. | الجدة | عم), the significance of historical characters and celebrities, etc. Place annotations reflect an intricate web of relations between “home” and the “other” with opposite epicentres in the two novels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Zaki","given":"Mai"}],"citation-key":"Zaki+2021+Whatsin; https://web.archive.org/web/20210930131947/https://dhsi.org/dhsi-2021-online-edition/dhsi-2021-online-edition-aligned-conferences-and-events/dhsi-2021-right-to-left/full-access/","event-place":"Online","event-title":"DHSI 2021: Right to Left","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,8]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Online","title":"What’s in a Name?
