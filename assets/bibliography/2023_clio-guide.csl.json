  {"id":"Crymble2021Technology","abstract":"Historians have seen their field transformed by the digital age. Research agendas, teaching and learning, scholarly communication, the nature of the archive—all have undergone a sea change that in and of itself constitutes a fascinating digital history. Yet technology's role in the field's development remains a glaring blind spot among digital scholars.\nAdam Crymble mines private and web archives, social media, and oral histories to show how technology and historians have come together. Using case studies, Crymble merges histories and philosophies of the field, separating issues relevant to historians from activities in the broader digital humanities movement. Key themes include the origin myths of digital historical research; a history of mass digitization of sources; how technology influenced changes in the curriculum; a portrait of the self-learning system that trains historians and the problems with that system; how blogs became a part of outreach and academic writing; and a roadmap for the continuing study of history in the digital era.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Crymble","given":"Adam"}],"call-number":"NB 2800 C957","citation-key":"Crymble2021Technology","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","publisher":"University of Illinois Press","source":"HU Grimm-Zentrum","title":"Technology and the Historian: Transformations in the Digital Age","type":"book","URL":"https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p085697"},

The book discusses Arabic script, phonology, orthography, morphology, syntax and semantics, with a final chapter on machine translation issues.The chapter sizes correspond more or less to what is linguistically distinctive about Arabic, with morphology getting the lion’s share, followed by Arabic script. No previous knowledge of Arabic is needed. This book is designed for computer scientists and linguists alike.

  {"id":"Zaagsma2022Politics","abstract":"Much has been made in recent years of the transformative potential of digital resources and historical data for historical research. Historians seem to be ﬂooded with retro-digitized and born-digital materials and tend to take these for granted, grateful for the opportunities they afford. In a research environment that increasingly privileges what is available online, the questions of why, where, and how we can access what we can access, and how it affects historical research have become ever more urgent. This article proposes a framework through which to contextualize the politics of (digital) heritage preservation, and a model to analyse its most important political dimensions, drawing upon literature from the digital humanities and history as well as archival, library, and information science. The ﬁrst part will outline the global dimensions of the politics of digital cultural heritage, focusing on developments between and within the Global North and South, framed within the broader context of the politics of heritage and its preservation. The second part surveys the history and current state of digitization and offers a structured analysis of the process of digitization and its political dimensions. Choices and decisions about selection for digitization, how to catalogue, classify, and what metadata to add are all political in nature and have political consequences, and the same is true for access. The article concludes with several recommendations and a plea to acknowledge the importance of digital cataloguing in enabling access to the global human record.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Zaagsma","given":"Gerben"}],"citation-key":"Zaagsma2022Politics","container-title":"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","DOI":"10.1093/llc/fqac050","ISSN":"2055-7671, 2055-768X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,16]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY-NC 4.0","page":"fqac050","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Digital History and the Politics of Digitization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/dsh/advance-article/doi/10.1093/llc/fqac050/6702047"}
