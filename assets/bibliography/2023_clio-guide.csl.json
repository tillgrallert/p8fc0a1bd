  {"id":"BenderEtal2021StochasticParrots","abstract":"The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bender","given":"Emily M."},{"family":"Gebru","given":"Timnit"},{"family":"McMillan-Major","given":"Angelina"},{"family":"Shmitchell","given":"Shmargaret"}],"citation-key":"BenderEtal2021StochasticParrots","collection-title":"FAccT '21","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","DOI":"10.1145/3442188.3445922","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-8309-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,3]]},"license":"CC BY 4.0","page":"610‚Äì623","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? ü¶ú","title-short":"On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922"},
  {"id":"Bondarev+2019+IntroductionOrthographicPolyphony","abstract":"Manuscript cultures based on Arabic script feature various tendencies in standardisation of orthography, script types and layout. Unlike previous studies, this book steps outside disciplinary and regional boundaries and provides a typological cross-cultural comparison of standardisation processes in twelve Arabic-influenced writing traditions where different cultures, languages and scripts interact. A wide range of case studies give insights into the factors behind uniformity and variation in Judeo-Arabic in Hebrew script, South Palestinian Christian Arabic, New Persian, Aljamiado of the Spanish Moriscos, Ottoman Turkish, a single multilingual Ottoman manuscript, Sino-Arabic in northwest China, Malay Jawi in the Moluccas, Kanuri and Hausa in Nigeria, Kabyle in Algeria, and Ethiopian Fid√§l script as used to transliterate Arabic. One of the findings of this volume is that different domains of manuscript cultures have distinct paths of standardisation, so that orthography tends to develop its own standardisation principles irrespective of norms applied to layout and script types. This book will appeal to readers interested in manuscript studies, sociolinguistics, literacy studies, and history of writing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Bondarev","given":"Dmitry"}],"citation-key":"Bondarev+2019+IntroductionOrthographicPolyphony","collection-number":"16","collection-title":"Studies in Manuscript Cultures","container-title":"Creating Standards: Interactions with Arabic script in 12 manuscript cultures","DOI":"10.1515/9783110639063-001","editor":[{"family":"Bondarev","given":"Dmitry"},{"family":"Gori","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Souag","given":"Lameen"}],"ISBN":"978-3-11-063906-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,15]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY-NC-ND 4.0","publisher":"De Gruyter","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"Introduction: Orthographic Polyphony in Arabic Script","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110639063-001/html"},

Using case studies, Crymble merges histories and philosophies of the field, separating issues relevant to historians from activities in the broader digital humanities movement. Key themes include the origin myths of digital historical research; a history of mass digitization of sources; how technology influenced changes in the curriculum; a portrait of the self-learning system that trains historians and the problems with that system; how blogs became a part of outreach and academic writing; and a roadmap for the continuing study of history in the digital era.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Crymble","given":"Adam"}],"call-number":"NB 2800 C957","citation-key":"Crymble2021Technology","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","publisher":"University of Illinois Press","source":"HU Grimm-Zentrum","title":"Technology and the Historian: Transformations in the Digital Age","type":"book","URL":"https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p085697"},

As the National Bibliographic Service catalogue (SBN) does not yet manage data in non-Latin scripts, the aim of DREAM is to offer researchers a catalogue searchable through original scripts (such as Arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic, etc.). One of the most remarkable features of the project is the creation of an ILS-independent working context in which the cataloguer may !nd and retrieve data in original script from authoritative catalogues, starting from the existing romanized ones. From a technical standpoint, the ever increasing Unicode support offered by modern operating systems, DBMSs and indexing engines makes the rapid development of the relevant software tools a concrete possibility. This in turn implies a shift in scienti!c focus towards the (often subtle) record linkage operations between different data sources. The authors hope that the DREAM project will gather the adhesion of other Italian libraries that perceive the same needs. Furthermore, as soon as SBN will support the management of data in non-Latin scripts, the DREAM project partners will be able to contribute with their data.","author":[{"family":"Fallerini","given":"Antonella"},{"family":"Galeffi","given":"Agnese"},{"family":"Ribichini","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Santanch√©","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Vallania","given":"Mattia"}],"citation-key":"FalleriniEtAl2022DREAM","container-title":"BIbliographic Control in the Digital Ecosystem","editor":[{"family":"Bergamin","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Guerrini","given":"Mauro"}],"event-place":"Florence","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY 4.0","note":"date_read: 2023-03-02","page":"347‚Äì355","publisher":"Firenze University Press","publisher-place":"Florence","source":"Google Scholar","title":"DREAM: a project about non-Latin script data","title-short":"DREAM","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"Zaagsma2022Politics","abstract":"Much has been made in recent years of the transformative potential of digital resources and historical data for historical research. Historians seem to be Ô¨Çooded with retro-digitized and born-digital materials and tend to take these for granted, grateful for the opportunities they afford. In a research environment that increasingly privileges what is available online, the questions of why, where, and how we can access what we can access, and how it affects historical research have become ever more urgent. This article proposes a framework through which to contextualize the politics of (digital) heritage preservation, and a model to analyse its most important political dimensions, drawing upon literature from the digital humanities and history as well as archival, library, and information science. The Ô¨Årst part will outline the global dimensions of the politics of digital cultural heritage, focusing on developments between and within the Global North and South, framed within the broader context of the politics of heritage and its preservation. The second part surveys the history and current state of digitization and offers a structured analysis of the process of digitization and its political dimensions. Choices and decisions about selection for digitization, how to catalogue, classify, and what metadata to add are all political in nature and have political consequences, and the same is true for access. The article concludes with several recommendations and a plea to acknowledge the importance of digital cataloguing in enabling access to the global human record.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Zaagsma","given":"Gerben"}],"citation-key":"Zaagsma2022Politics","container-title":"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","DOI":"10.1093/llc/fqac050","ISSN":"2055-7671, 2055-768X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,16]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY-NC 4.0","page":"fqac050","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Digital History and the Politics of Digitization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/dsh/advance-article/doi/10.1093/llc/fqac050/6702047"}
