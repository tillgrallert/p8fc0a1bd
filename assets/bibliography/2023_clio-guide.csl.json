  {"id":"Arnold2022MultilingualResearchProjects","abstract":"Academic research about digital non-Latin script (hereafter: NLS) research data can pose a number of challenges just because the material is from a region where the Latin alphabet was not used. Not all of them are easy to spot. In this paper, I introduce two use cases to demonstrate different aspects of the complex tasks that may be related to NLS material. The first use case focuses on metadata standards used to describe NLS material. Taking the VRA Core 4 XML as example, I will show where we found limitations for NLS material and how we were able to overcome them by expanding the standard. In the second use case, I look at the research data itself. Although the full-text digitization of western newspapers from the 20th century usually is not problematic anymore, this is not the case for Chinese newspapers from the Republican era (1912–1949). A major obstacle here is the dense and complex layout of the pages, which prevents OCR solutions from getting to the character recognition part. In our approach, we are combining different manual and computational methods like crowdsourcing, pattern recognition, and neural networks to be able to process the material in a more efficient way. The two use cases illustrate that data standards or processing methods that are established and stable for Latin script material may not always be easily adopted to non-Latin script research data.Des recherches académiques sur les recherches de textes numériques qui ne sont pas en alphabet latin (désormais NLS) peuvent poser plusieurs défis, car le matériel vient d’une région où l’alphabet latin n’était pas utilisé. Ils ne sont pas tous faciles à trouver. Dans cet article, je vais présenter deux cas d’utilisation pour démontrer les différents aspects des tâches complexes qui pourraient être reliées au matériel NLS. Le premier cas d’utilisation focus sur les standards de métadonnées utilisés pour décrire le matériel NLS. En prenant comme exemple le VRA Core 4 XML, je montre où se trouvent les limitations pour le matériel NLS et comment nous sommes capables de les surmonter en augmentant les standards. Pour le deuxième cas d’utilisation, je regarde les données de recherches elles-mêmes. Même si la numérisation de textes complets de journaux occidentaux du 20e siècle n’est plus problématique, ce n’est pas le cas pour les journaux chinois de l’ère républicaine (1912-1949). Un obstacle majeur est la densité et la complexité de la mise en page, ce qui empêche les solutions OCR (reconnaissance optique de caractères) de se rendre à la partie de reconnaissance des caractères. Dans notre approche, nous avons combiné des méthodes manuelles et computationnelles différentes comme l’externalisation ouverte (crowdsourcing), la reconnaissance de motifs, et le réseau neuronal pour procéder au matériel de manière plus efficace. Les deux cas d’utilisations démontrent que les données standards ou les méthodes de traitement qui sont établies et stables pour le matériel en alphabet latin ne peuvent être utilisées facilement pour des données qui ne sont pas en alphabet latin.&nbsp;","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,29]]},"archive":"https://web.archive.org/web/20230302224422/https://www.digitalstudies.org/article/id/8110/","author":[{"family":"Arnold","given":"Matthias"}],"citation-key":"Arnold2022MultilingualResearchProjects","container-title":"Digital Studies / Le champ numérique","DOI":"10.16995/dscn.8110","ISSN":"1918-3666","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,28]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Open Library of Humanities","source":"www.digitalstudies.org","title":"Multilingual Research Projects: Non-Latin Script Challenges for Making Use of Standards, Authority Files, and Character Recognition","title-short":"Multilingual Research Projects","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.digitalstudies.org/article/id/8110/","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"BenderEtal2021StochasticParrots","abstract":"The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bender","given":"Emily M."},{"family":"Gebru","given":"Timnit"},{"family":"McMillan-Major","given":"Angelina"},{"family":"Shmitchell","given":"Shmargaret"}],"citation-key":"BenderEtal2021StochasticParrots","collection-title":"FAccT '21","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","DOI":"10.1145/3442188.3445922","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-8309-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,3]]},"license":"CC BY 4.0","page":"610–623","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? 🦜","title-short":"On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922"},

  {"id":"Bondarev+2019+IntroductionOrthographicPolyphony","abstract":"Manuscript cultures based on Arabic script feature various tendencies in standardisation of orthography, script types and layout. Unlike previous studies, this book steps outside disciplinary and regional boundaries and provides a typological cross-cultural comparison of standardisation processes in twelve Arabic-influenced writing traditions where different cultures, languages and scripts interact. A wide range of case studies give insights into the factors behind uniformity and variation in Judeo-Arabic in Hebrew script, South Palestinian Christian Arabic, New Persian, Aljamiado of the Spanish Moriscos, Ottoman Turkish, a single multilingual Ottoman manuscript, Sino-Arabic in northwest China, Malay Jawi in the Moluccas, Kanuri and Hausa in Nigeria, Kabyle in Algeria, and Ethiopian Fidäl script as used to transliterate Arabic. One of the findings of this volume is that different domains of manuscript cultures have distinct paths of standardisation, so that orthography tends to develop its own standardisation principles irrespective of norms applied to layout and script types. This book will appeal to readers interested in manuscript studies, sociolinguistics, literacy studies, and history of writing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Bondarev","given":"Dmitry"}],"citation-key":"Bondarev+2019+IntroductionOrthographicPolyphony","collection-number":"16","collection-title":"Studies in Manuscript Cultures","container-title":"Creating Standards: Interactions with Arabic script in 12 manuscript cultures","DOI":"10.1515/9783110639063-001","editor":[{"family":"Bondarev","given":"Dmitry"},{"family":"Gori","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Souag","given":"Lameen"}],"ISBN":"978-3-11-063906-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,15]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY-NC-ND 4.0","publisher":"De Gruyter","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"Introduction: Orthographic Polyphony in Arabic Script","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110639063-001/html"},

As Black people across the globe consider their place in the future following the past two decades of technological advancement, Afrofuturism and its relevance for the humanities has become ever pertinent. While Afrofuturism has thus far been discussed through a literary, artistic, or popular culture lens, growing use of new technologies, and its resultant intersections with the reality of our racial experiences, has created a need for approaching Afrofuturism from a digital studies perspective. Via detailed case studies, Bryan W. Carter introduces the field of Digital Africana Studies to demonstrate how this new area can be experienced pedagogically. Alongside the book, readers can also visit select Digital Africana Studies projects that exemplify the various technologies and projects described at the author's website: ibryancarter.com/projects.

  {"id":"DuPreez2018VoicesSouth","abstract":"This volume captures the status of digital humanities within the Arts in South Africa. The primary research methodology falls within the broader tradition of phenomenological hermeneutics, with a specific emphasis on visual hermeneutics. Some of the tools utilised as part of the visual hermeneutic methods are geographic information system (GIS) mapping, sensory ethnography and narrative pathways. Digital humanities is positioned here as the necessary engagement of the humanities with the pervasive digital culture of the 21st century. It is posited that the humanities and arts, in particular, have an essential role to play in unlocking meaning from scientific, technological and data-driven research. The critical engagement with digital humanities is foregrounded throughout the volume, as this crucial engagement works through images. Images (as understood within image studies) are not merely another form of text but always more than text. As such, this book is the first of its kind in the South African scholarly landscape, and notably also a first on the African continent. Its targeted audience include both scholars within the humanities, particularly in the arts and social sciences. Researchers pursuing the new field of digital humanities may also find the ideas presented in this book significant. Several of the chapters analyse the question of dealing with digital humanities through representations of the self as viewed from the Global South. However, it should be noted that self-representation is not the only area covered in this volume.

These public manifestations of piracy, though, conceal an elite worldwide, underground, organized network of pirate groups who specialize in obtaining media – music, videos, games, and software – before their official sale date and then racing against one another to release the material for free. Warez: The Infrastructure and Aesthetics of Piracy is the first scholarly research book about this underground subculture, which began life in the pre-internet era Bulletin Board Systems and moved to internet File Transfer Protocol servers (“topsites\") in the mid- to late-1990s. The “Scene,\" as it is known, is highly illegal in almost every aspect of its operations. The term “Warez\" itself refers to pirated media, a derivative of “software.\" Taking a deep dive in the documentary evidence produced by the Scene itself, Warez describes the operations and infrastructures an underground culture with its own norms and rules of participation, its own forms of sociality, and its own artistic forms. Even though forms of digital piracy are often framed within ideological terms of equal access to knowledge and culture, Eve uncovers in the Warez Scene a culture of competitive ranking and one-upmanship that is at odds with the often communalist interpretations of piracy.

  {"id":"Eve2022LessonsLibrary","abstract":"At 33TB of data in its main collection, the highly illegal Library Genesis project is one of the largest repositories of copyright-violating educational ebooks ever created. Established over a decade ago in 2008, the goal of Library Genesis is nothing short of a modern Library of Alexandria, albeit without anyone’s legal sanction. As one of its administrators wrote: “within decades, generations of people everywhere in the world will grow up with access to the best scientific texts of all time. [...] [T]he quality and accessibility of education to the poor will grow dramatically too. Frankly, I see this as the only way to naturally improve mankind: we need to make all the information available to them at any time” [Bodó 2018b]. Rooted in its homeland’s Russian communist principles and particularly the Soviet isolationist copyright policies of the twentieth century, Library Genesis is a formidable resource and threat to conventional academic publishers.\n\nThe Library Genesis database had just short of 1.2m records (books) in 2014 [Bodó 2018a]. As of January 2020, this capacity has doubled to 2.5m books. In this article, I examine the minimal computational design choices taken by this maximal-in-intent, illicit archive of epistemological dissent and how such decisions have shaped the scalability and growth of the platform. This includes Library Genesis’s numerical subdivision of record identifiers into “buckets” to work around directory file limitations in the GNU/Linux operating system; its use of md5 hashing of filenames within directories capped at 1,000 files to avoid future hashing collisions while allowing for on-disk integrity checking; and its use of the MySQL socket/network server as opposed to SQLite or similar disk-based database.\n\nBeyond these computational details, though, the theoretical tension that this article highlights is the path dependencies that are set in (illegal) computational projects that have goals of absolute abundance and maximalist capacity, and the minimalist design principles that they must instigate at the outset to ensure a degree of scalability. I also query the ways in which the project’s contested mission statements target an economic (geographic) audience demographic with only minimalist access to high-capacity computing resources. I finally examine the limits on scalability of the distribution of the Library Genesis through its torrent archive and other distributed networking technologies such as IPFS, which despite their promise of peer-to-peer redundancy fall down on an archive of this size.","author":[{"family":"Eve","given":"Martin Paul"}],"citation-key":"Eve2022LessonsLibrary","container-title":"Digital Humanities Quarterly","container-title-short":"DHQ","editor":[{"family":"Gil","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Risam","given":"Roopika"}],"issue":"2,  \"Minimal Computing\"","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,28]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY-ND 4.0","note":"date_read: 2022-08-04","title":"Lessons from the Library: Extreme Minimalist Scaling at Pirate Ebook Platforms","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000587/000587.html","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"Fiormonte2021Taxation","abstract":"In Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History, Michel-Rolph Trouillot writes that by examining the process of history we can “discover the differential exercise of power that makes some narratives possible and silences others.” Alternative Historiographies of the Digital Humanities examines the process of history in the narrative of the digital humanities and deconstructs its history as a straight line from the beginnings of humanities computing. By discussing alternatives histories of the digital humanities that address queer gaming, feminist game studies praxis, Cold War military-industrial complex computation, the creation of the environmental humanities, monolingual discontent in DH, the hidden history of DH in English studies, radical media praxis, cultural studies and DH, indigenous futurities, Pacific Rim postcolonial DH, the issue of scale and DH, the radical, indigenous, feminist histories of the digital database, and the possibilities for an antifascist DH, this collection hopes to re-set discussions of the straight, white origin myths of DH. Thus, this collection hopes to reexamine the silences in such a straight and white masculinist history and delineates how power comes into play to shape this straight, white DH narrative.  A number of the pieces in this volume go back to the origin myth of the digital humanities to reassess the hagiography of Father Busa by reconsidering and recontextualizing his legacy and his work in relation to media archaeology, politics, Cold War maneuvers, mechanized genocide, the Third Reich, and the military-industrial complex as it has organized various fields, including Asian Studies. This reassessment of comparative genealogies — vis-à-vis Foucault — undergirds an alternative history of the Jesuit hagiography we have so far been unwilling to reexamine for its narrative use in embellishing an origin hagiography/historiography for digital humanities. Other pieces intertwine the digital humanities with other fields — area studies, Asian American Studies, cultural studies, literary studies, and environmental studies — in order to reexamine how the intersections and juxtapositions reveal silences in these histories. And finally, a number of pieces considers alternative praxes in rethinking these histories, whether it is an essay that is a game or a reevaluation of feminist media praxis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Fiormonte","given":"Domenico"}],"citation-key":"Fiormonte2021Taxation","container-title":"Alternative Historiographies of the Digital Humanities","DOI":"10.53288/0274.1.00","editor":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Dorothy"},{"family":"Koh","given":"Adeline"}],"event-place":"Earth","ISBN":"978-1-953035-58-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,24]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY-SA-NC 4.0","page":"333-376","publisher":"punctum books","publisher-place":"Earth","title":"Taxation against Overrepresentation?

  {"id":"FiormonteEtAl2015PoliticsOfCode","abstract":"1. Introduction Digital languages and instruments are not only powerful tools for simplifying and enhancing the work of humanists and social scientists, they also create new cultural representations and self-representations that transform both the epistemology and the practice of research.\nIn particular, digital representations can influence and shape our cultural artefacts and everyday experiences in various ways. For example, we are influenced in the way we represent everyday digital objects, such as the Windows folder as a metaphor for &lsquo;document box&rsquo;. This is at the level of the interfaces that &lsquo;produce users through benign interactions [&hellip;]. That is, as ideology create subjects, interactive and seemingly real-time interfaces create users who believe they are the &ldquo;source&rdquo; of the computer&rsquo;s action&rsquo; (Chun 2011: 66-68). We are also influenced by the ways in which we write software or encode a document through specific languages (e.g. &nbsp;Python or HTML). However, it is easy to demonstrate that such a distinction is artificial (and often damaging). From a semiotic point of view, both representations (visible interface and invisible coding) are &lsquo;modelling systems&rsquo; (Uspenskij et al. 1973) that cast their influence on overlapping political, social, cognitive and epistemological domains. In the first case we are talking about an influence mainly on practices and processes (social and cognitive dimensions), and in the second case we are dealing with the theory and interpretation of information structures (linguistic, hermeneutical and epistemological dimensions).\nIn our paper we will focus on this second aspect, and show some examples of how code and encodings are shaping the way we conceive and practise the work of reconstruction, conservation and representation of information structures and cultural artefacts. To this aim, we will discuss three encoding tools widely used in the Humanities and Social Sciences communities: HTML, the de facto standard for encoding World Wide Web documents and pages, Unicode, an industry standard designed to allow text and symbols from all of the writing systems of the world to be consistently represented and manipulated by computers, and XML (eXtensible Markup Language), which defines a set of rules for encoding documents.\n2. HTML War\nThe evolution of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) as a structural language and application standard of the World Wide Web has been largely shaped by forces outside of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the international community assembled by Tim Berners-Lee &lsquo;to lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the Web.&rsquo; (http://www.w3.org/Consortium/)\nEven before it became a W3C Recommendation on October 28, 2014, HTML5 had already reached in 2009 the status of a de facto standard on the Web. This was promoted and encouraged by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a community established by Apple, the Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software (joined later by Google) that was in open opposition to the development of the language of the Web as envisioned by the W3C and &lsquo;concerned about the W3C&rsquo;s direction with XHTML, lack of interest in HTML and apparent disregard for the needs of real-world authors.&rsquo; (https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#What_is_the_WHATWG.3F)\nAs in the days of the browser wars between Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer (Sordi 2010), tensions collide (and versions are released) around the code of the World Wide Web that appear to be inspired by benefits for the authors and the users of the Web, but in in fact were tied to strategies to control a market that Web 2.0 apps, social media and the eternal promise of the Semantic Web have once again enhanced (Zeldman - Marcotte 2010).\nControlling the development of HTML means controlling the competition between the different software used to access the Web (Ford 2014); managing the scheduling and release of mobile applications that can now compete at the same level as desktop applications, without being forced to adopt or implement competing solutions; and to determine how texts and information on the Web can be searched and placed interrelated, making the definitive migration from a Web based on document search to a system for collecting user data. In other words, behind the HTML war there is a growing obsession by industry and governments with our digital traces, habits and personal information (Lyon &ndash; Bauman 2013; Bowker 2013).\n3. The cultural and political biases of XML\nA markup language permits us to formally describe the structure of a text, and to analyse the data in depth. Its utility will be in proportion to how much information it can set out, include and preserve. The word &lsquo;markup&rsquo; itself shows its original bias: ironically, like other computing languages, XML is one the most faithful successors to the Gutenberg model; its basic aim is to imitate and preserve structured information as laid out in modern printed books. But is hierarchical and structured information an inherent and universal feature of texts (let alone writing)? The bias inherited from print has forced us to think of a text as a stable product, but if we either look at the different historical representations of a given text or at its documented writing stages, it is clear that there is not one text, but as many different texts as there are mechanisms of writing, material production, intertextual paths and methodologies of reconstruction (Fiormonte &ndash; Schmidt &ndash; Martiradonna 2010). Not only there is a potential conflict between the linear and hierarchical nature of current markup languages, and the intrinsic dynamic nature of the writing process, current text encoding tools and methodologies seems to constitute the most serious obstacle to the development of an independent theory of digital text.\nA typical example of the overlapping between geopolitical settings and technical choices can be found in organisations like the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), an international consortium that defines guidelines for encoding cultural heritage documents in XML. However, the practice of defining encoding standards to allow electronic documents to be processed ultimately by shared software at the presentation level, does not work nearly as well for the encoding of historical primary sources (Schmidt 2014). Attempts to declare &lsquo;standard&rsquo; names for textual features overlook significant variations in the interpretation, selection and application of those codes by different groups, individuals and cultures. Once again, the &lsquo;practice&rsquo; of code is the result of the &lsquo;theory&rsquo; reflected by certain groups and interests. Encoding tools and methodologies become examples of &lsquo;symbolic capital&rsquo; (Bourdieu 1984) used by the TEI community to &nbsp;export a universalising, western-centric approach to the representation of cultural artefacts.\n4. Universalizing the typography: Unicode &nbsp;\nThe Unicode standard aims at constituting a universal and inclusive mapping of all graphemes from existing and past writing systems. Yet, some assumptions that underlie the standard are shaped by the culture-specific standardisation of the graphical representation of language generated by Gutenberg&rsquo;s invention of moveable type printing.\nThe Unicode writing system, now forced upon all scripts, is based on a discrete ordered sequence of individual characters flowing only in one direction and dimension. However, in many writing systems based on handwriting, including contemporary Arabic and some Indic scripts, some graphemes &lsquo;orbit&rsquo; around a central grapheme and can be written not only after (left or right, depending on the main direction of the script), but also before, above or under the &lsquo;main&rsquo; grapheme. This is the case of ancient Greek &lsquo;hypogegrammenon (subscribed) iota&rsquo;, written before another vowel if lowercase, but after that vowel if uppercase. A wider case study is provided by the right-to-left Indic scripts where some vowels, although pronounced after a consonant, may be written before it (The Unicode Consortium 2014, chapter 12.1; Perri 2009; Constable 2001, II, par. 6.3).\nAnother assumption underlying the Unicode model is a one-to-one correspondence between phoneme and grapheme. The European medieval handwriting conventions based on the Greek or Latin alphabets are an interesting case study in this respect: ligatures, brevigraphs (sometimes represented by apparent diacritics such as macrons) and logographs are systematic and &lsquo;regular&rsquo; here, and the underlying model is incompatible with the Unicode/Gutenberg one-to-one correspondence between a phoneme and a character in a linear sequence. However, the XML/TEI Guidelines for the transcription of pre-modern primary sources simply recommend the use of Unicode for this purpose (TEI P5 Guidelines, chapter 5).\nIn all these cases, the current version of Unicode imposes the Gutenberg model (based on the Latin alphabet used in Europe in the Modern Age) upon writing systems based on different models, and all discrepancies are treated as &lsquo;exceptions&rsquo; to be dealt with at the presentational rendering level through software workarounds.\n5. Conclusions\nThese case studies show that digital &lsquo;standards&rsquo; always reflect a cultural bias (Carey 2009), and that the level of encoding is never neutral, but tends to assume (and overlap with) universalising discourses that are usually invisible at the surface of technology (Galloway 2012).\nDigital Universalism (Chan 2014) is deeply intertwined with the question of language, which in its turn controls our encoding practices. Code imperialism and linguistic imperialism (Phillipson 2009) are two sides of the same coin. We are facing a codex universalis, based on the English lingua franca, used to articulate and exert a power of &nbsp;standardisation and control.\nBut codes and encoding(s) before or along &lsquo;semiotic&rsquo;, &lsquo;hermeneutic&rsquo; or &lsquo;cultural&rsquo; are also political phenomena. &nbsp;Looking at boards, offices and steering committees reveals that consortia, associations and organisations like Unicode, ICANN , TEI or the W3C are informed by Anglophone hegemonies, and their decisions are shaped by their commercial interests, ideologies and cultures. So apparently &lsquo;neutral&rsquo;, &lsquo;technical&rsquo; decisions, as can be observed in Unicode, TEI or other organisations, tend to oversimplify and standardise the complex diversity of languages and cultural artefacts.\nAs Friedrich Kittler put it: &lsquo;Codes&mdash;by name and by matter&mdash;are what determine us today, and what we must articulate if only to avoid disappearing under them completely. &hellip; Today, technology puts code into the practice of realities, that is to say: it encodes the world&rsquo; (Kittler 2008: 40). &nbsp;So, is it still in our power to code (encode reality), or rather is code imposing on us its biases and constraints?\nIn the conclusion of our presentation we will try to propose solutions to avoid or reduce the impact of universalistic encoding, and report on alternative experiences and experiments that try to resist the effects of &lsquo;colonial computing&rsquo; (Ali 2014).References\nAli, Mustafa (2014). &ldquo;Towards a decolonial computing&rdquo;, CEPE 2013: Computer Ethics: Philosophical Enquiry, 1-3 July 2013, Lisbon, Portugal, International Society of Ethics and Information Technology, pp. 28&ndash;35.\nBauman, Zygmunt and Lyon, David (2013).

  {"id":"FiormonteEtAl2022GlobalDebates","abstract":"Often conceived of as an all-inclusive “big tent,” digital humanities has in fact been troubled by a lack of perspectives beyond Westernized and Anglophone contexts and assumptions. This latest collection in the Debates in the Digital Humanities series seeks to address this deficit in the field. Focused on thought and work that has been underappreciated for linguistic, cultural, or geopolitical reasons, contributors showcase alternative histories and perspectives that detail the rise of the digital humanities in the Global South and other “invisible” contexts and explore the implications of a globally diverse digital humanities.\n\nAdvancing a vision of the digital humanities as a space where we can reimagine basic questions about our cultural and historical development, this volume challenges the field to undertake innovation and reform.\n\nContributors: Maria José Afanador-Llach, U de los Andes, Bogotá; Maira E.

  {"id":"Forbes2019InternationalPerspectives","abstract":"With large-scale scholarly projects dedicated to digitizing print-based magazines and a concurrent turn towards digital mapping and data visualization, periodicals that were once accessible only in the archive now have the capacity to reach a wider audience, and make visible previously overlooked networks and connections enacted within and across the magazines. International Perspectives on Publishing Platforms: Image, Object, Text offers a unique contribution to the field of periodical studies, while also broadening the scope of purview to consider related content with regards to other relevant printed matter and cultural products, as well as digital archiving strategies. Including interdisciplinary contributions from academics around the world, the volume presents a wide range of approaches to periodicals and printed matter from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Questions of material print culture and the digital realm are considered both via theoretical and more empirical approaches. As a whole, the book considers the pluralism of perspectives that the study of periodicals and printed matter contribute to our historical understanding of various political and social issues, and also devotes attention to the ways in which digital archiving projects can be instrumentalized as a strategy for filling in gaps in the historical record. International Perspectives on Publishing Platforms should be of great interest to researchers, academics and postgraduates engaged in the study of periodicals, publishing, book history, world literature, digital humanities, media, visual and material culture","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,5]]},"citation-key":"Forbes2019InternationalPerspectives","collection-title":"Digital research in the arts and humanities","editor":[{"family":"Forbes","given":"Meghan"}],"event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-0-429-49151-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 1080190685","number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"London","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"International perspectives on publishing platforms: image, object, text","title-short":"International perspectives on publishing platforms","type":"book","URL":"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=1989950"},
  {"id":"Gitelman2019Raw","abstract":"We live in the era of Big Data, with storage and transmission capacity measured not just in terabytes but in petabytes (where peta- denotes a quadrillion, or a thousand trillion). Data collection is constant and even insidious, with every click and every \"like\" stored somewhere for something. This book reminds us that data is anything but \"raw,\" that we shouldn't think of data as a natural resource but as a cultural one that needs to be generated, protected, and interpreted. The book's essays describe eight episodes in the history of data from the predigital to the digital. Together they address such issues as the ways that different kinds of data and different domains of inquiry are mutually defining; how data are variously \"cooked\" in the processes of their collection and use; and conflicts over what can -- or can't -- be \"reduced\" to data. Contributors discuss the intellectual history of data as a concept; describe early financial modeling and some unusual sources for astronomical data; discover the prehistory of the database in newspaper clippings and index cards; and consider contemporary \"dataveillance\" of our online habits as well as the complexity of scientific data curation.

  {"id":"Goldsmith2020Duchamp","abstract":"In 1996, during the relatively early days of the web, Kenneth Goldsmith created UbuWeb to post hard-to-find works of concrete\npoetry. What started out as a site to share works from a relatively obscure literary movement grew into an essential archive of\ntwentieth- and twenty-first-century avant-garde and experimental\nliterature, film, and music. Visitors around the world now have\naccess to both obscure and canonical works, from artists such as\nKara Walker, Yoko Ono, Pauline Oliveros, Samuel Beckett, Marcel\nDuchamp, Cecil Taylor, Glenn Ligon, William Burroughs, and Jean-Luc Godard.\n\n\n\nIn  <i>Duchamp Is My Lawyer</i> , Goldsmith tells the history of UbuWeb, explaining the motivations behind its creation and how\nartistic works are archived, consumed, and distributed online.\nBased on his own experiences and interviews with a variety of\nexperts, Goldsmith describes how the site navigates issues of\ncopyright and the ways that UbuWeb challenges familiar\nconfigurations and histories of the avant-garde. The book also\nportrays the growth of other \"shadow libraries\" and includes a\nsection on the artists whose works reflect the aims, aesthetics,\nand ethos of UbuWeb. Goldsmith concludes by contrasting UbuWeb's\ncommitment to the free-culture movement and giving access to a wide range of artistic works with today's gatekeepers of algorithmic\nculture, such as Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Goldsmith","given":"Kenneth"}],"citation-key":"Goldsmith2020Duchamp","DOI":"10.7312/gold18694","ISBN":"978-0-231-18694-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"publisher":"Columbia University Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"Duchamp Is My Lawyer: The Polemics, Pragmatics, and Poetics of UbuWeb","title-short":"Duchamp Is My Lawyer","type":"book","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/gold18694"},

  {"id":"Karaganis2018ShadowLibraries","abstract":"# Abstract\n\nHow students get the materials they need as opportunities for higher education expand but funding shrinks.From the top down, Shadow Libraries explores the institutions that shape the provision of educational materials, from the formal sector of universities and publishers to the broadly informal ones organized by faculty, copy shops, student unions, and students themselves. It looks at the history of policy battles over access to education in the post–World War II era and at the narrower versions that have played out in relation to research and textbooks, from library policies to book subsidies to, more recently, the several “open” publication models that have emerged in the higher education sector.From the bottom up, Shadow Libraries explores how, simply, students get the materials they need. It maps the ubiquitous practice of photocopying and what are—in many cases—the more marginal ones of buying books, visiting libraries, and downloading from unauthorized  \n\n It looks at the informal networks that emerge in many contexts to share materials, from face-to-face student networks to Facebook groups, and at the processes that lead to the consolidation of some of those efforts into more organized archives that circulate offline and sometimes online— the shadow libraries of the title. If Alexandra Elbakyan՚s Sci-Hub is the largest of these efforts to date, the more characteristic part of her story is the prologue: the personal struggle to participate in global scientific and educational communities, and the recourse to a wide array of ad hoc strategies and networks when formal, authorized means are lacking. If Elbakyan՚s story has struck a chord, it is in part because it brings this contradiction in the academic project into sharp relief—universalist in principle and unequal in practice. Shadow Libraries is a study of that tension in the digital era.ContributorsBalázs Bodó, Laura Czerniewicz, Miroslaw Filiciak, Mariana Fossatti, Jorge Gemetto, Eve Gray, Evelin Heidel, Joe Karaganis, Lawrence Liang, Pedro Mizukami, Jhessica Reia, Alek Tarkowski","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,25]]},"citation-key":"Karaganis2018ShadowLibraries","collection-title":"International Development Research Centre","DOI":"10.7551/mitpress/11339.001.0001","editor":[{"family":"Karaganis","given":"Joe"}],"event-place":"Boston","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY-NC-ND 4.0","publisher":"The MIT Press","publisher-place":"Boston","title":"Shadow Libraries","type":"book","URL":"http://archive.org/details/dli.doa.203"},

  {"id":"Kim.Koh+2021+AlternativeHistoriographies","abstract":"In Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History, Michel-Rolph Trouillot writes that by examining the process of history we can “discover the differential exercise of power that makes some narratives possible and silences others.” Alternative Historiographies of the Digital Humanities examines the process of history in the narrative of the digital humanities and deconstructs its history as a straight line from the beginnings of humanities computing. By discussing alternatives histories of the digital humanities that address queer gaming, feminist game studies praxis, Cold War military-industrial complex computation, the creation of the environmental humanities, monolingual discontent in DH, the hidden history of DH in English studies, radical media praxis, cultural studies and DH, indigenous futurities, Pacific Rim postcolonial DH, the issue of scale and DH, the radical, indigenous, feminist histories of the digital database, and the possibilities for an antifascist DH, this collection hopes to re-set discussions of the straight, white origin myths of DH. Thus, this collection hopes to reexamine the silences in such a straight and white masculinist history and delineates how power comes into play to shape this straight, white DH narrative.  A number of the pieces in this volume go back to the origin myth of the digital humanities to reassess the hagiography of Father Busa by reconsidering and recontextualizing his legacy and his work in relation to media archaeology, politics, Cold War maneuvers, mechanized genocide, the Third Reich, and the military-industrial complex as it has organized various fields, including Asian Studies. This reassessment of comparative genealogies — vis-à-vis Foucault — undergirds an alternative history of the Jesuit hagiography we have so far been unwilling to reexamine for its narrative use in embellishing an origin hagiography/historiography for digital humanities. Other pieces intertwine the digital humanities with other fields — area studies, Asian American Studies, cultural studies, literary studies, and environmental studies — in order to reexamine how the intersections and juxtapositions reveal silences in these histories. And finally, a number of pieces considers alternative praxes in rethinking these histories, whether it is an essay that is a game or a reevaluation of feminist media praxis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,25]]},"citation-key":"Kim.Koh+2021+AlternativeHistoriographies","DOI":"10.53288/0274.1.00","editor":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Dorothy"},{"family":"Koh","given":"Adeline"}],"event-place":"Earth","ISBN":"978-1-953035-58-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,24]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY-SA-NC 4.0","note":"https://web.archive.org/web/20210907155709/https://punctumbooks.com/titles/alternative-historiographies-of-the-digital-humanities/","publisher":"punctum books","publisher-place":"Earth","title":"Alternative Historiographies of the Digital Humanities","type":"book","URL":"https://punctumbooks.com/titles/alternative-histories-of-the-digital-humanities/"},
  {"id":"KimStommel2018DisruptingDigital","abstract":"\"All too often, defining a discipline becomes more an exercise of exclusion than inclusion. Disrupting the Digital Humanities seeks to rethink how we map disciplinary terrain by directly confronting the gatekeeping impulse of many other so-called field-defining collections. What is most beautiful about the work of the Digital Humanities is exactly the fact that it can't be tidily anthologized. In fact, the desire to neatly define the Digital Humanities (to filter the DH-y from the DH) is a way of excluding the radically diverse work that actually constitutes the field. This collection, then, works to push and prod at the edges of the Digital Humanities -- to open the Digital Humanities rather than close it down. Ultimately, it's exactly the fringes, the outliers, that make the Digital Humanities both heterogeneous and rigorous. This collection does not constitute yet another reservoir for the new Digital Humanities canon. Rather, its aim is less about assembling content as it is about creating new conversations. Building a truly communal space for the digital humanities requires that we all approach that space with a commitment to: 1) creating open and non-hierarchical dialogues; 2) championing non-traditional work that might not otherwise be recognized through conventional scholarly channels; 3) amplifying marginalized voices; 4) advocating for students and learners; and 5) sharing generously and openly to support the work of our peers.\"--Back cover","citation-key":"KimStommel2018DisruptingDigital","editor":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Dorothy"},{"family":"Stommel","given":"Jesse"}],"event-place":"Goleta","ISBN":"978-1-947447-71-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY-NC-SA 4.0","note":"OCLC: 1065523749","number-of-pages":"509","publisher":"Punctum Books","publisher-place":"Goleta","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Disrupting the digital humanities","type":"book"},

  {"id":"KresseSounaye2022Thinking","abstract":"# publisher's abstract\n\nAs far too many intellectual histories and theoretical contributions from the ‘global South’ remain under-explored, this volume works towards redressing such imbalance. Experienced authors, from the regions concerned, along different disciplinary lines, and with a focus on different historical timeframes, sketch out their perspectives of envisaged transformations. This includes specific case studies and reflexive accounts from African, South Asian, and Middle Eastern contexts. Taking a critical stance on the ongoing dominance of Eurocentrism in academia, the authors present their contributions in relation to current decolonial challenges. Hereby, they consider intellectual, practical and structural aspects and dimensions, to mark and build their respective positions. From their particular vantage points of (trans)disciplinary and transregional engagement, they sketch out potential pathways for addressing the unfinished business of conceptual decolonization. The specific individual positionalities of the contributors, which are shaped by location and regional perspective as much as in disciplinary, biographical, linguistic, religious, and other terms, are hereby kept in view. Drawing on their significant experiences and insights gained in both the global north and global south, the contributors offer original and innovative models of engagement and theorizing frames that seek to restore and critically engage with intellectual practices from particular regions and transregional contexts in Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East.

  {"id":"Lalu2017VirtualStampede","abstract":"This article presents a polemical argument for a politics of digitisation that aims to politicise the archival disciplines while making sense of the conjuncture in which digitisation initiatives are mooted in Southern Africa. It argues for a blurring of the work of archivist and historian in reconstituting the archive of the liberation struggle. It alters the paradigmatic frameworks of the Cold War that have hitherto defined the structure of the archive. The article provisionally anticipates the trajectories of a politics of digitisation, while complicating our notion of information by tracking its emergence in colonialism and the restrictive paradigms of the Cold War. Calling for a constitution of the archive that undercuts both colonial precedents and Cold War paradigms, it argues for a politics of digitisation that will expand what can be said about the history of liberation struggles in Southern Africa by redefining the meaning of the postcolonial. The realignment is intended to provoke new conceptualisations of globalisation and the archive in the postcolony.","author":[{"family":"Lalu","given":"Premesh"}],"citation-key":"Lalu2017VirtualStampede","container-title":"Innovation: Journal of Appropriate Librarianship and Information Work in Southern Africa","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","page":"28-44","source":"Zotero","title":"The Virtual Stampede for Africa: digitisation, postcoloniality and archives of the liberation struggles in Southern Africa","type":"article-journal","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"PasekEtAl2023World","abstract":"The climate impacts of the information and communications technology sector?and Big Data especially?is a topic of growing public and industry concern, though attempts to quantify its carbon footprint have produced contradictory results. Some studies argue that information and communications technology's global carbon footprint is set to rise dramatically in the coming years, requiring urgent regulation and sectoral degrowth. Others argue that information and communications technology's growth is largely decoupled from its carbon emissions, and so provides valuable climate solutions and a model for other industries. This article assesses these debates, arguing that, due to data frictions and incommensurate study designs, the question is likely to remain irresolvable at the global scale. We present six methodological factors that drive this impasse: fraught access to industry data, bottom-up vs. top-down assessments, system boundaries, geographic averaging, functional units, and energy efficiencies. In response, we propose an alternative approach that reframes the question in spatial and situated terms: A relational footprinting that demarcates particular relationships between elements?geographic, technical, and social?within broader information and communications technology infrastructures. Illustrating this model with one of the global Internet's most overlooked components?subsea telecommunication cables?we propose that information and communications technology futures would be best charted not only in terms of quantified total energy use, but in specifying the geographical and technical parts of the network that are the least carbon-intensive, and which can therefore provide opportunities for both carbon reductions and a renewed infrastructural politics. In parallel to the politics of (de)growth, we must also consider different network forms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Pasek","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Vaughan","given":"Hunter"},{"family":"Starosielski","given":"Nicole"}],"citation-key":"PasekEtAl2023World","container-title":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/20539517231158994","ISSN":"2053-9517","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"20539517231158994","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The world wide web of carbon: Toward a relational footprinting of information and communications technology's climate impacts","title-short":"The world wide web of carbon","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"Putnam2016Transnational","abstract":"This essay explores the consequences for historians’ research of the twinned transnational and digitized turns. The accelerating digitization of primary and secondary sources and the rise of full-text web-based search to access information within them has transformed historians’ research practice, radically diminishing the role of place-specific prior expertise as a prerequisite to discovery. Indeed, we can now find information without knowing where to look. This has incited remarkably little reflection among mainstream historians, but the consequences are profound. What has become newly possible? How do the new digital affordances relate to the current boom in transnational topics and approaches? How do the reach, speed, and granularity of digitized search impact our ability to reconstruct the supranational past? This essay heralds the novel forms of knowledge-generation made possible by technological transformations. It also attempts an accounting of all the ancillary learning that international research in an analog world once required.

The chapter goes beyond the binary approach of ‘have’ and ‘have not’, by introducing and discussing the third level of digital divide, seen as the social and cultural benefits deriving from accessing and using the Internet, stressing how social and digital inequalities are intertwined. The third level of digital divide focuses on the social consequences of Internet usage and it moves away the focus from the digital arena, by addressing it as a social issue.\n\n# critique\n\n- doesn't mention knowledge of languages, and particularly knowledge of English, as impeding access","author":[{"family":"Ragnedda","given":"Massimo"}],"citation-key":"Ragnedda+2019","container-title":"Mapping the digital divide in Africa: A mediated analysis","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctvh4zj72.6","editor":[{"family":"Mutsvairo","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Ragnedda","given":"Massimo"}],"event-place":"Amsterdam","ISBN":"9789462986855","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","note":"BibTeX Key: Ragnedda+2019\noclc: 1090685704\nuuid: 02744793-A893-4FEC-A2DA-8C2AAB36508E","page":"27-44","publisher":"Amsterdam University Press","publisher-place":"Amsterdam","source":"WorldCat","title":"Conceptualising the digital divide","type":"chapter"},

And how can African diaspora studies inform the practices of digital humanities? These questions are at the heart of this timely collection of essays about the relationship between digital humanities and Black Atlantic studies, offering critical insights into race, migration, media, and scholarly knowledge production. The Digital Black Atlantic spans the African diaspora's range--from Africa to North America, Europe, and the Caribbean--while its essayists span academic fields--from history and literary studies to musicology, game studies, and library and information studies. This transnational and interdisciplinary breadth is complemented by essays that focus on specific sites and digital humanities projects throughout the Black Atlantic. Covering key debates, The Digital Black Atlantic asks theoretical and practical questions about the ways that researchers and teachers of the African diaspora negotiate digital methods to explore a broad range of cultural forms including social media, open access libraries, digital music production, and video games. The volume further highlights contributions of African diaspora studies to digital humanities, such as politics and representation, power and authorship, the ephemerality of memory, and the vestiges of colonialist ideologies.

  {"id":"Sam2019Bridging","abstract":"This chapter advances the debate on the social aspect of digital divide in Africa, by focusing specif ically on literacy and language as fundamental barriers to digital inclusion in Sierra Leone. The chapter addresses two questions: (i) how do illiteracy and language barriers influence the access and effective use of digital technology such as mobiles and mobile Internet in Africa, and (ii) how do marginalised individuals, with limited language and literacy skills, overcome these social barriers of the digital divide? The author builds on ethnographic data collected through mixed methods from rural and urban communities to address these questions. The analysis shows that high illiteracy and language barriers increase the digital gap among the marginalised, not because they do not have access to the technology, but because they lack the required basic literacy and language skills to make timely, independent ownership decisions and effective use. Further analysis of the data using Everett Rogers’ diffusion of innovation model, indicates that some marginalised individuals negotiate language and literacy barriers of the digital divide through social networks of family and friends. The results imply that an individual level of adoption depends on the condition(s) under which the process occurs within one´s personal networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Sam","given":"Steven"}],"citation-key":"Sam2019Bridging","container-title":"Mapping Digital Divide in Africa: A Mediated Analysis","DOI":"10.1515/9789048538225-013","editor":[{"family":"Mutsvairo","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Ragnedda","given":"Massimo"}],"event-place":"Amsterdam","ISBN":"978-90-485-3822-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,31]]},"language":"en","page":"215-256","publisher":"Amsterdam University Press","publisher-place":"Amsterdam","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Bridging the Digital Gap in Sub-Saharan Africa.

These repositories are still exclusively operated in the “Global North”. Can they meet the global diversity of requirements? How can these platforms be managed with cultural humility? A planned open-access knowledge sharing platform for the field of international cultural relations is the occasion for this study. The production of knowledge in this field takes place globally in institutions of different type: academic, educational, political and economic. The communities of practise produce classic publishers’ publications, but also so-called “grey literature” which often is hard to discover and preserve. The report is based on desk research, supplemented by a three-months open commenting period, and a public workshop whose participants dispose over substantive experience with the analysed technologies and practises, or are members of the communities of practise, amongst them experts who work in “Global South” contexts. In result, a recommendation matrix was developed which tackles the most important issues: balancing “Global North” privileges by subtraction instead of just adding diversity, working towards social justice by involving the communities of practise from the very start, setting up a polycentric governance structure based on values defined by the communities, establishing ethics of care and translation processes to mediate different roles and to accommodate individual needs, supporting multilingualism, low connectivity environments, interoperability and experiments, all with a critical stance towards standardisation and rationalisation, planning for the long term sustainably, collaborating and cooperating, doing everything transparently, at a moderate pace, learning humbly and perpetually.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Nora"}],"citation-key":"Schmidt2023OpenAccess","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,4]]},"language":"eng","source":"Zenodo","title":"Open-Access Repositories Decolonial.

We live in a media-saturated society that increasingly transforms our experiences, relations, and identities into data others can analyze and monetize. Algorithms are key to this process, surveilling our most mundane practices, and to many, their control over our lives seems absolute. In Living with Algorithms, Ignacio Siles critically challenges this view by surveying user dynamics in the global south across three algorithmic platforms--Netflix, Spotify, and TikTok--and finds, surprisingly, a more balanced relationship. Drawing on a wealth of empirical evidence that privileges the user over the corporate, Siles examines the personal relationships that have formed between users and algorithms as Latin Americans have integrated these systems into the structures of everyday life, enacted them ritually, participated in public with and through them, and thwarted them. Sometimes users follow algorithms, Siles finds, and sometimes users resist them. At times, users do both. Agency lies in the navigation of the spaces in-between. By analyzing what we do with algorithms rather than what algorithms do to us, Living with Algorithms clarifies the debate over the future of datafication and whether we have a say in its development. Concentrating on an understudied region of the global south, the book provides a new perspective on the commonalities and differences among users within a global ecology of technologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Siles","given":"Ignacio"}],"citation-key":"Siles2023Living","event-place":"Boston","ISBN":"978-0-262-54542-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,25]]},"language":"en","publisher":"MIT Press","publisher-place":"Boston","source":"bookshop.org","title":"Living with Algorithms: Agency and User Culture in Costa Rica","title-short":"Living with Algorithms","type":"book","URL":"https://bookshop.org/p/books/living-with-algorithms-agency-and-user-culture-in-costa-rica-ignacio-siles/18738790"},

In a growing society like ours, description and documentation of human and scientific evidence/resources are improving. However, these resources have enjoyed cost-effective solutions for Western languages but are yet to flourish for African tone languages. By situating discussions around a universe of discourse, sufficient to engender cross-border interactions within the African context, this book shall break a dichotomy of challenges on adaptive processes required to unify resources to assist the development of modern solutions for the African domain","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Urua","given":"Eno-Abasi"}],"citation-key":"Urua2022CurrentIssues","editor":[{"family":"Ekpenyong","given":"Moses Effiong"},{"family":"Udoh","given":"Imelda Icheji Lawrence"}],"event-place":"Singapore","ISBN":"978-981-19293-2-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 1357153679","number-of-pages":"719","publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"Singapore","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Current issues in descriptive linguistics and digital humanities: a festschrift in honor of Professor Eno-Abasi Essien Urua","title-short":"Current issues in descriptive linguistics and digital humanities","type":"book","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-2932-8"},

  {"id":"Weinberg1974Transliteration","abstract":"The validity of transliteration in documentation is questioned in light of the resulting loss of precise information. The process is examined from the linguist's, cataloguer's, and user's points of view. The pros and cons of phonetic transcription vs. scientific transliteration are discussed. Specific problems of several non‐Roman alphabets are touched upon. The author advocates development of non‐Latin print chains for computers used for documentation work. Where the cost of this is prohibitive, scientific transliteration is imperative for the purposes of international documentation. For library purposes, maintenance of separate catalogues for each script is recommended.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Weinberg","given":"Bella"}],"citation-key":"Weinberg1974Transliteration","container-title":"Journal of Documentation","DOI":"10.1108/eb026567","ISSN":"0022-0418","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1974,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"18-31","source":"Emerald Insight","title":"Transliteration in Documentation","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"Wittern2013Character","abstract":"Text encoding comprises character encoding, but goes beyond that, since it is also concerned with re-creating the structure of a text in electronic form. Text encoding is sometimes also confused with markup, which is a methodology used in text encoding to express information about structure, status, or other special features of a text. This chapter first focuses on the relationship of character encoding and writing systems in a very general sense and history of character encoding. Then, it talks about the single most important coded character set in use today, namely Unicode. The chapter further discusses the intricacies of Unicode. Finally, it attempts to clarify some of the underlying concepts and shows how to deal with them in practice.","author":[{"family":"Wittern","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"Wittern2013Character","container-title":"A Companion to Digital Literary Studies","DOI":"10.1002/9781405177504.ch31","editor":[{"family":"Siemens","given":"Ray"},{"family":"Schreibman","given":"Susan"}],"event-place":"Chichester","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","note":"date_read: 2023-03-28","page":"564-576","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher-place":"Chichester","title":"Character Encoding","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"Zaagsma2022Politics","abstract":"Much has been made in recent years of the transformative potential of digital resources and historical data for historical research. Historians seem to be ﬂooded with retro-digitized and born-digital materials and tend to take these for granted, grateful for the opportunities they afford. In a research environment that increasingly privileges what is available online, the questions of why, where, and how we can access what we can access, and how it affects historical research have become ever more urgent. This article proposes a framework through which to contextualize the politics of (digital) heritage preservation, and a model to analyse its most important political dimensions, drawing upon literature from the digital humanities and history as well as archival, library, and information science. The ﬁrst part will outline the global dimensions of the politics of digital cultural heritage, focusing on developments between and within the Global North and South, framed within the broader context of the politics of heritage and its preservation. The second part surveys the history and current state of digitization and offers a structured analysis of the process of digitization and its political dimensions. Choices and decisions about selection for digitization, how to catalogue, classify, and what metadata to add are all political in nature and have political consequences, and the same is true for access. The article concludes with several recommendations and a plea to acknowledge the importance of digital cataloguing in enabling access to the global human record.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Zaagsma","given":"Gerben"}],"citation-key":"Zaagsma2022Politics","container-title":"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","DOI":"10.1093/llc/fqac050","ISSN":"2055-7671, 2055-768X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY-NC 4.0","note":"date_original: 2022-09-16","page":"830–851","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Digital History and the Politics of Digitization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/dsh/advance-article/doi/10.1093/llc/fqac050/6702047","volume":"38"},
